## üîç Short Introduction

This Azure Internship Capstone Project demonstrates the implementation of an advanced security monitoring system that transforms traditional application monitoring into a comprehensive threat detection platform for Django web applications deployed in Microsoft Azure.

### What This Project Does

By leveraging **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights**, we've built an intelligent early warning system that:
- **Detects security threats in real-time** before they can compromise your application
- **Monitors for attack patterns** including SQL injection, XSS, and brute force attempts
- **Analyzes user behavior** to identify suspicious activities and anomalies
- **Automates incident response** through customized alerts and security playbooks

### Why It Matters

Traditional monitoring focuses on performance metrics, but this project addresses the critical gap in **proactive security monitoring**. It embodies the "shift security left" principle by identifying vulnerabilities and threats at the earliest possible stage, significantly reducing the attack surface and potential impact of security incidents.

### Key Innovation

Unlike standard monitoring solutions, this system uses **security-focused KQL queries** and **custom threat detection algorithms** specifically tailored for Django applications, providing security teams with actionable intelligence rather than just raw data.

### Target Audience

- **Security Engineers** implementing DevSecOps practices
- **Django Developers** building secure cloud applications  
- **Azure Architects** designing resilient monitoring systems
- **IT Security Teams** seeking proactive threat detection

This project serves as both a working implementation and a blueprint for establishing robust security monitoring in Azure-hosted Django applications, demonstrating how modern cloud platforms can be leveraged to create sophisticated security operations centers.

#### a) Metric Alerts
- Based on time series data emitted by Azure resources
- You need to select:
  * A specific metric of interest
  * Aggregation type
  * Threshold value for triggering

#### b) Log Alerts
- Based on queries against logs stored in a Log Analytics workspace
- Allow you to define complex scenarios for alerting
- Utilize the Log Analytics query language (KQL)

#### c) Activity Log Alerts
- Based on events from the activity log
- Notify you when specific events occur in your Azure environment

### 4. Defining Actions When Alert Triggers
- You can choose an existing Action Group or create a new one
- To create a new Action Group:
  * Provide a name for the Action Group
  * Input the name of the action
  * Select the action type (email, SMS, webhook, etc.)
  * Enter relevant details for the chosen action type

#### Additional Configuration for Webhooks:
- Enter your webhook URL to receive notifications
- It's recommended to enable the "Common Alert Schema" for standardized alert formats
- This simplifies automation of responses through webhooks, Logic Apps, or runbooks

### 5. Finalizing Settings
- Specify the alert name and description
- Define the severity level
- Click "Create alert rule" to complete

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# KQL Query Explanation

This query analyzes web application HTTP logs to detect 400 errors within the last 5 minutes. Let's break it down step by step:

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. `AppServiceHTTPLogs`
- **What it does:** Selects the table containing HTTP logs from Azure App Service
- **Contains:** All HTTP requests to your web application (URLs, status codes, IP addresses, etc.)

### 2. `| where TimeGenerated >= ago(5m)`
- **What it does:** Filters records by time
- **Result:** Shows only records from the last 5 minutes
- **ago(5m)** = 5 minutes ago from current time

### 3. `| where ScStatus == 400`
- **What it does:** Filters by HTTP status code
- **Result:** Keeps only requests with 400 error (Bad Request)
- **ScStatus** = Server Status Code

### 4. `| summarize Count = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1m)`
- **What it does:** Groups and counts records
- **Count = count()** = counts the number of records in each group
- **bin(TimeGenerated, 1m)** = groups by minutes (each minute = one "bin")
- **Result:** Number of 400 errors for each minute

### 5. `| where Count > 0`
- **What it does:** Shows only minutes where errors occurred
- **Result:** Hides minutes with zero error count

## Example Output

| TimeGenerated | Count |
|---------------|-------|
| 2025-05-27 14:55:00 | 3 |
| 2025-05-27 14:57:00 | 1 |
| 2025-05-27 14:59:00 | 2 |

## Practical Use Cases

This query is perfect for:
- **Real-time monitoring** - detecting issues quickly
- **Alert rules** - automatic notifications when errors occur
- **Trend analysis** - understanding error frequency patterns

## Possible Modifications

**For longer time period:**
```kusto
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(1h)  // Last hour
```

**For other errors:**
```kusto
| where ScStatus >= 400 and ScStatus < 500  // All client errors
```

# Azure Internship Capstone Project

## Proactive Security Monitoring for Django Applications in Azure

## (Previos: Create Demo Project on Alerts in Azure Monitor for Django Web Application)

### Project Overview

This project implements a security-focused monitoring and alerting system for Django web applications deployed in Azure. By combining Azure Monitor capabilities with security engineering principles, we've created an early warning system that detects potential security threats, anomalous behavior, and application vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

### Security Objectives

- Detect and alert on potentially malicious HTTP requests and injection attempts
- Monitor for unusual access patterns and authentication anomalies
- Identify application vulnerabilities through error rate analysis
- Create security baselines and detect deviations in application behavior
- Implement defense-in-depth through multi-layer monitoring


## üîç Project Overview

This capstone project transforms standard application monitoring into a robust security monitoring system for Django applications deployed in Azure. By leveraging Azure Monitor capabilities and security engineering principles, we've created an early warning system for potential security threats and application vulnerabilities.
