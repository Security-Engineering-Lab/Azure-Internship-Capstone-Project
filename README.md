### Alerts Monitoring
Alerts proactively notify you when issues are found with your infrastructure or application using your monitoring data in Azure Monitor. They allow you to identify and address issues before the users of your system notice them.

# Weekly Report: 05/02/2025 - 05/09/2025


### 1) Description of Programs/Tasks for the Week

* **Completed the deployment** of a Python Django web application with PostgreSQL in Azure according to the tutorial - configured the environment, database and successfully deployed the application.

* Prepared 50% of the **demo project on alerts in Azure Monitor for the Django web application** - configured the main types of alerts (availability, performance, resource usage).

* **Completed 50% of the learning path "Developing a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Strategy"** - mastered the modules on the basics of SRE and approaches to system monitoring.

* Completed 100% of the course **"Data analysis with Kusto Query Language"** - mastered the basic syntax and used KQL to analyze web application logs.

* **Configured Application Insights for the Django application** - integrated the SDK, configured telemetry collection and data visualization.

* Developed test scripts to generate load on the web application to demonstrate alert triggering.

### 2) Impressions from the Materials

**Liked:**
* Detailed instructions for deploying a Django application with clear explanations of each step.
* Practical approach to learning KQL with the ability to immediately test queries on real data.
* Comprehensive coverage of various aspects of SRE with an emphasis on practical application.
* Many examples of configuring different types of alerts in the Azure Monitor documentation.

**Disliked/needs changes:**
* I would like to see more examples of using KQL specifically for analyzing web application performance problems.

**I would like to learn more:**
* Automate alert rule creation using ARM Templates or Azure CLI.
* Correlate alerts with metrics using Advanced KQL.
* Configure predictive alerts based on ML models in Azure Monitor.

### 3) Work with a Mentor

* **Conducted an analysis of the monitoring architecture for Python web applications in Azure.**
* Developed a demonstration structure that covers the full alert lifecycle.
* Received recommendations on using Log Analytics for advanced analysis of performance issues.
* Worked out alert demonstration scenarios for different types of web application issues.

### 4) Next Week's Agenda - Top 3 Tasks

1. Complete the preparation of a full Azure Monitor alert demo for a Django web application, including all alert types (metrics, logs, availability, errors, anomalies).

2. Prepare a presentation script with a step-by-step demonstration of all aspects of working with alerts - from creating rules to responding to incidents.

3. Develop a comprehensive monitoring system for a Django application using custom metrics and KQL queries to identify non-trivial performance issues.
