### üöÄ [Live Demo](https://msdocs-python-postgres-235-cmb4dccwfbf7emhx.westeurope-01.azurewebsites.net/)

## üéØ Security Objectives

- **Threat Detection**: Real-time alerting on potentially malicious HTTP requests and injection attempts
- **Access Monitoring**: Identification of unusual access patterns and authentication anomalies
- **Vulnerability Discovery**: Early detection of application weaknesses through error rate analysis
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Creation of security baselines with alerting on suspicious deviations
- **Defense in Depth**: Implementation of multi-layered monitoring for comprehensive coverage

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Security Monitoring Components  

1. **Attack Vector Detection**: Tracking and alerting on SQL injection, XSS, and path traversal attempts
2. **Authentication Monitoring**: Identifying brute force attempts and unauthorized access patterns
3. **Security-focused KQL Queries**: Advanced threat detection using Kusto Query Language
4. **Incident Response Automation**: Configuring security playbooks for common attack scenarios
5. **Security Testing Framework**: Specialized tools to simulate attack vectors and validate defense mechanisms

### Security Value Proposition

This security monitoring solution enhances the application's security posture by:

- Providing real-time visibility into potential security incidents
- Reducing the attack surface through early vulnerability detection
- Creating an audit trail of security-relevant events for compliance
- Enabling rapid incident response through automated alerting
- Building a security knowledge base through trend analysis of attack patterns

The project serves as a security operations blueprint for Django applications in Azure, demonstrating how to transform standard application monitoring into a robust security monitoring system that aligns with the principle of "shifting security left" in the development lifecycle.

# Weekly Report: 12/05/2025 - 16/05/2025

##  Setting Up Alerts in Azure Monitor

## Key Steps for Alert Configuration

### 1. Accessing Alert Creation
- Open Azure Monitor

![](https://github.com/Security-Engineering-Lab/Azure-Internship-Capstone-Project/blob/main/images/1_AzureMonitor.png)
  
- Navigate to the "Alerts" section

![](https://github.com/Security-Engineering-Lab/Azure-Internship-Capstone-Project/blob/main/images/2_AzureMonitor.png)
  
- Click "Add new alert rule"

### 2. Defining the Target Resource (Scope)
- Select the resource(s) you want to monitor

![](https://github.com/Security-Engineering-Lab/Azure-Internship-Capstone-Project/blob/main/images/3_AzureMonitor.png)

- Available signals depend on the chosen scope:
  * At subscription level - activity log signals are available
  * At VM level - metric and activity log signals are available
  * For Log Analytics workspace - log signals are available
- Multi-resource metric alert rules are supported for specific resource types

![](https://github.com/Security-Engineering-Lab/Azure-Internship-Capstone-Project/blob/main/images/6_AzureMonitor.png)




### 3. Configuring Alert Conditions

Azure offers three main types of alerts:

#### a) Metric Alerts
- Based on time series data emitted by Azure resources
- You need to select:
  * A specific metric of interest
  * Aggregation type
  * Threshold value for triggering

#### b) Log Alerts
- Based on queries against logs stored in a Log Analytics workspace
- Allow you to define complex scenarios for alerting
- Utilize the Log Analytics query language (KQL)

#### c) Activity Log Alerts
- Based on events from the activity log
- Notify you when specific events occur in your Azure environment

### 4. Defining Actions When Alert Triggers
- You can choose an existing Action Group or create a new one
- To create a new Action Group:
  * Provide a name for the Action Group
  * Input the name of the action
  * Select the action type (email, SMS, webhook, etc.)
  * Enter relevant details for the chosen action type

#### Additional Configuration for Webhooks:
- Enter your webhook URL to receive notifications
- It's recommended to enable the "Common Alert Schema" for standardized alert formats
- This simplifies automation of responses through webhooks, Logic Apps, or runbooks

### 5. Finalizing Settings
- Specify the alert name and description
- Define the severity level
- Click "Create alert rule" to complete

## (Previos: Create Demo Project on Alerts in Azure Monitor for Django Web Application)

### Project Overview

This project implements a security-focused monitoring and alerting system for Django web applications deployed in Azure. By combining Azure Monitor capabilities with security engineering principles, we've created an early warning system that detects potential security threats, anomalous behavior, and application vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

### Security Objectives

- Detect and alert on potentially malicious HTTP requests and injection attempts
- Monitor for unusual access patterns and authentication anomalies
- Identify application vulnerabilities through error rate analysis
- Create security baselines and detect deviations in application behavior
- Implement defense-in-depth through multi-layer monitoring
