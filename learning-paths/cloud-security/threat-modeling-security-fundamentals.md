https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/tm-threat-modeling-fundamentals/


This learning path takes you through the four main phases of threat modeling, explains the differences between each data-flow diagram element, walks you through the threat modeling framework, recommends different tools and gives you a step-by-step guide on creating proper data-flow diagrams.

#### Prerequisites
- None

# 1. Introduction to threat modeling

Threat modeling is an effective way to help secure your systems, applications, networks, and services. It's an engineering technique that identifies potential threats and offers recommendations to help reduce risk and meet security objectives earlier in the development lifecycle.

# Learning objectives
In this module, you will:
- Understand the importance of capturing requirements and assumptions when creating a data-flow diagram.
- Read about the framework that helps you find security issues in a system.
- Learn about the security control categories that help you reduce or eliminate potential threats.
- Highlight the importance of verifying assumptions, requirements, and fixes before deployment.


# 1.1 Introduction

Threat modeling is an effective technique to help secure your systems, applications, networks, and services. It helps you identify potential threats and risk reduction strategies earlier in the development lifecycle.

Threat modeling uses a data-flow diagram that graphically shows how the system works. It then applies a framework to help you find and fix security issues.

Systems released without first being threat modeled place your customers and organization at risk.

> To make things easier, this learning path refer to systems, applications, and services as just *systems*.

## When to use threat modeling

Use threat modeling whenever you design new systems or update existing ones. Examples include:

* Creating a new Azure micro-service that reports on your organization's cloud resource usage for budgeting purposes.
* Designing a public API to provide customers access to your data.
* Adding a new feature to an existing application.

## Who can threat model

Anyone with a working knowledge of the system and a basic understanding of security can work with threat modeling. This technique can be applied across any:

* Software delivery approach, for example, Agile or Waterfall.
* Deployment cadence, such as hourly, monthly, or annually.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you explore the four high-level steps of threat modeling so that you can:

* Understand the importance of capturing requirements and assumptions when creating a data-flow diagram.
* Read about the framework that helps you find security issues in a system.
* Learn about the security-control categories that help you reduce or eliminate potential threats.
* Highlight the importance of verifying assumptions, requirements, and fixes before deployment.
