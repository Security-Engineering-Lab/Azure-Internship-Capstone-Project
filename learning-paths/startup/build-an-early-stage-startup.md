https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/startups/


This learning path is for early-stage startup founders, and anyone working on an idea for a startup. It acts as a guide to the core business concepts you need to know to launch a successful startup.

The modules are based on industry best practices. The content also draws from the deep experience of the Microsoft for Startups team and from the knowledge of thought leaders such as Eric Ries, Steve Blank, Ash Maurya, Paul Graham, David Bland, and Cindy Alvarez.

By completing this learning path, you'll acquire an understanding of:
- Startup fundamentals.
- Validating your startup idea with customers.
- Getting to revenue.
- Naming and branding.
- Building your team.
- Fundraising for your startup.
- How to pitch your company.

You'll also learn what actions are likely to increase the chances of your startup being successful, and what common pitfalls you should avoid.



### Startup fundamentals

This module gives an overview of the startup fundamentals and core business concepts you need to launch a successful startup.


# Introduction

In this module, we focus on startup basics so that you have a solid guide to lead you on your journey with Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub.

We start by discussing some personal considerations:
- What's it really like to found a startup; not the hype, but the nuts and bolts of the journey and what to expect.
- How to manage your time and energy.
- When to transition to building your business full-time.

We also discuss what makes a startup successful, and why having a business model that's repeatable and scalable is essential. Just as importantly, you learn about some of the most common reasons that startups fail so you can avoid making these mistakes.

Finally, we talk about what founders should focus on in the first year of managing their startup. This discussion helps you map out the next few steps of your own journey.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn:
- How to think about the startup journey from a personal perspective and prepare for the road ahead.
- How to decide if you're ready to pursue your idea full-time.
- What factors help startups succeed and how you can take actions early on that improve your chance of success.
- What mistakes cause startups to fail and how to avoid them.
- What to focus on in the first year of launching your startup.



# Should you found a startup?

Let's assume that you're here because you're working on an early-stage startup or a startup idea. You'd like to make sure you have a good grasp of essential startup concepts before you go much further.

How will you know if founding a startup is right for you? For many startup founders (and aspiring founders), there are a few critical considerations that can help to answer this important question.

## Are you passionate about solving a specific problem?

To be a successful entrepreneur, you need to be passionate about solving a problem. Many successful entrepreneurs report that they would have pursued their idea regardless of whether there was a business opportunity; they were that passionate about solving that particular problem.

The road from startup idea to successful business is often a long one, with the typical time from launch to exit being anywhere from 4 to 10 years.

Bear in mind that few startup founders set out with anything like this commitment up front. It's entirely rational to start a company with a modest time horizon and become more committed as the opportunity solidifies and the company grows.

Nevertheless, it's much easier for you to devote meaningful time to solving a problem if you're passionate about it. This is especially the case in the early days, when there's likely to be lots of hard work and before you reach any significant commercial milestones.

> **Tip**
> 
> Ask yourself: Am I passionate about solving this problem, and can I imagine devoting years of my life to working on it?

## Do you have deep domain expertise?

The odds of a startup succeeding are always higher if the founders have unique insights into the problem space—or domain expertise—in which their startup is going to operate. These insights are typically acquired over a long period of time (either through work or a personal interest), accompanied by a thirst for understanding problems and exploring potential solutions.

In fact, in the early days of many startups, these unique insights are the only competitive advantage the company has. So, it's important to make sure you're able to identify and articulate the insights on which you're going to base your startup.

There are four main ways in which startup founders can take advantage of their domain expertise to create value:

1. **By identifying an important problem that many others don't realize exists.** Many great startup ideas came from time spent "marinating" in the problem space, exploring interesting problems with potential customers and developing unique insights over a long period of time. Finding great problems to work on often means skipping over the problems on which everyone else is working and identifying others that are hidden or that seem unsolvable, but that still represent a great opportunity.

2. **By coming up with a compelling solution that's unlikely to occur to others, and might even seem unlikely to succeed.** Historically, many of the best startup ideas seemed wild at the outset, and it was only with hindsight that their value became evident.

3. **By making connections with customers that would be difficult for a newcomer to make.** Founders can tap into their existing network, or use their profile as a thought leader.

4. **By developing novel, cutting-edge technology that can become the basis for the company's competitive advantage.** Especially with deep-tech startups that are based on advanced technology or scientific research.

> **Tip**
> 
> Ask yourself:
> 
> - Does my startup idea take advantage of the time and energy I've already invested in my career or my other interests?
> - What insights do I have (that most of my peers don't) that will open up an opportunity that might have been invisible to others?

## How much financial freedom do you have?

Almost all startups require an up-front investment in product and market development before meaningful revenues start to flow.

Technically capable founders might have a slight advantage over non-technical founders. They can spend their time building the product, rather than having to spend cash to pay an external developer to build it for them.

Nevertheless, it's vital that all startup founders understand the likely cost of building and launching their product. This awareness helps them budget for this expenditure and ensure that they can get their product in the hands of customers before they run out of money.

As a startup founder, you need to work on three tasks to determine your startup's financial runway:

1. **Understand the cost of building and launching your product.** This estimate should include all outlays, including legal, marketing, and staffing costs.

2. **Predict the likely revenues you'll generate when the product is in the hands of customers.** Consider how long it will take to reach that juncture.
   
   - This prediction is the trickiest part, and many would argue that forecasting future revenues for a pre-launch startup is at best a rough guess.
   - Almost all startup pitch decks are heavily influenced by optimism bias. They have a revenue chart that goes steeply up and to the right. A good rule of thumb is to double the length of time you think it will take to get to revenue, and halve the amount of revenue you think you'll generate.

3. **Determine how much capital you have and are willing to invest in the company** before it receives funding from revenues or external investment. If you have cofounders, this is a great topic to discuss as a team.

Answering these questions helps you develop a cashflow forecast that allows you to make informed decisions about where to invest time and money early on.

## What is your risk tolerance?

A startup is one of the most uncertain business environments in which you can place yourself. To be successful as a startup founder, it's critical that you're not just comfortable with uncertainty, but that you thrive in this dynamic environment.

An important part of this process is considering your own risk tolerance in the context of your personal financial commitments.

Everyone has their own unique risk profile, but as a generalization, risk tolerance for most people is highest when they're young. Younger individuals tend to have relatively few financial obligations and don't yet have an established career. If founding a startup doesn't work out (or takes longer than planned to get off the ground), it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, at least financially.

Risk tolerance generally decreases over time. As people take on financial commitments like buying a house and have responsibilities such as supporting a family, they tend to be less willing to take large financial risks.

Additionally, opportunity cost generally increases over time. It can be more difficult to leave a successful career in which you've invested over many years than to start something when your career is still in its infancy.

As a founder, you should think about your own risk tolerance at the beginning of the startup journey. If you have cofounders, this is an excellent time to have a frank and open conversation about each individual's risk profile and financial situation. It's a good idea to find out whether you're collectively aligned on these fronts.

> **Tip**
> 
> Ask yourself: How much cash am I willing to put into this company? How much income am I willing to forego as I work on this company instead of doing other paid work? What's the minimum income that I need to generate, and can I do that while working on this startup? What are my financial objectives, and will they be met by building this startup?

## Are the cofounders aligned?

Misaligned expectations among cofounders can lead to a loss of team cohesion. This is one of the most common causes of startup failure, particularly if it occurs early in the startup's life.

Cofounder misalignment can take many forms, including:

- **Differences in the amount of time, money, and/or energy** each founder is willing to put into the company, particularly before it generates significant revenues or raises external funding.
- **Differences in what each founder wants to get out of building the startup.** These differing desires can include financial reward, freedom, self-actualization, or fame and recognition.
- **Differences in how each founder views success for the company.** They might have differing goals about financial success, impact on the world, solving the problem on which the startup is focused, or some other outcome.

The good news is that by identifying misalignment early on, it's often possible to address any issues before they become a destructive force.

One way to do this is for cofounders to each reflect on their individual goals for the company and themselves, to write these down, and then to come together as a team and discuss their responses.

Even if you're a sole founder, it's still useful to capture these thoughts and discuss them with friends, family, or your partner. You can "pressure test" your own goals and the viability of your expectations.

## When should you go full-time?

At some point, founders need to make the decision to step back from other work in order to focus exclusively on building their startup. However, it's a common myth that startup founders should commit full-time to their startup from the beginning.

For most people, this isn't a rational path. If you have finite financial resources and some immovable financial commitments, it's generally wiser to commit to your startup incrementally. Start with a small time commitment, during which you test your idea and establish whether it's worth proceeding any further.

It's helpful to think about the early stages of your startup as an opportunity to explore and experiment. You don't need to lock in a business model or decide on exactly what product to build right away. Instead, approach these things iteratively over a period of time so that you can have some certainty about what product to build and who's going to pay for it.

Many people can do this part-time around their existing job or other commitments.

By identifying critical milestones or inflection points that allow you to build increasing conviction, you can identify stages in the development of your company. These stages allow you to commit additional time and money as you gain greater certainty about the prospects of your company.

Founders should consciously decide to invest their time and money into their startup in the same way that an investor would decide to invest in your company. Base your investment on a rational and hard-nosed assessment of the company's prospects, including the extent to which the founders have been able to identify, address, and retire the core risks that could cause the startup to fail.

For example, make an investment case to yourself that begins: "It's rational for me to invest this amount of my time and/or money at this point, because..." The things that should convince you that it's sensible to invest might include validating core assumptions, receiving positive feedback from potential customers, and generating early revenues.

### Scenario: A milestone chart for commitments

Emily is working on an idea for a financial tech startup that she hopes will make it easier for people to consolidate the bank feeds they receive from multiple banks. She comes from a consumer banking background, and she's pretty sure the idea has value.

However, she's decided that she wants to test some of her assumptions with potential customers. Moreover, she wants to do this before making any moves to leave her job or investing significant amounts of time and money in building a product.

Emily has decided that she'll stagger her commitment of time and money to the company by using milestones that reflect the de-risking of the opportunity. To help her think this through, Emily created a milestone chart and penciled in some commitments that she'd be willing to make as she hits each milestone.

| When I hit this milestone | I'll be willing to invest this much time in my startup | I'll be willing to invest this much of my own cash | This is rational because |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Complete 50 customer interviews, and at least 50 percent identify with the problem and would be interested in a solution. | One person-month (evenings and weekends) over the next three months to build a minimum viable product (MVP). | $500 to run some social ad campaigns to test demand. | I won't need to reduce my income and I have enough savings to pay for the ads. |
| Launch MVP, get at least 100 people using it, and collect positive feedback. | One day per week (reduce job to four days), plus evenings and weekends, to focus on building version 1 of the product and connecting with at least three banks. | $5,000 to hire a front-end developer to help build the product. | I've discussed this matter with my manager, and she's supportive of me taking time off to explore this without jeopardizing my employment.<br><br>I have enough savings to cover the reduced income and am willing to cut back on some discretionary expenditure. |
| Launch v 1.0 and get first 50 paying customers. | Leave my job to go full-time, but with up to two days a week available to do contract or project work if I need the income. | $10,000 to keep front-end developer working on the product, and to do some paid customer acquisition. | Having 50 paying customers demonstrates demand for the product and represents $5,000 in revenue. |
| 200 paying customers and at least 90 percent retention of the first 50 customers after six months. | Full-time | $20,000 in savings, will need to raise seed round soon! | 200 customers equate to $20,000 in revenues.<br><br>High retention rate supports assumption of high lifetime value of customers.<br><br>Should be enough to raise a seed round. |

# What makes startups succeed?

Successful startups share a number of important attributes. In this unit, you learn about some of the most common shared attributes of successful startups, and you can score your startup against them.

By understanding what makes startups succeed, you're able to bake some of these attributes into your startup from the very beginning.

## Non-obvious idea

Every startup needs to be based on a good idea. Unfortunately for many founders, the idea they decide to work on is self-evidently good. This means that many other people are likely to have had the same idea, and the company will therefore most likely be competing with other startups, or even large enterprises, doing something similar.

Some of the best startup ideas sound wild at first but are actually a good idea. This makes them a great startup idea, because not many people are working on the same thing.

Consider the following Venn diagram:

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/startup/fundamentals/media/learning-path-basic-venn-diagram.png)

The blue set on the left represents all ideas that sound absurd. When you first describe these ideas to people, their most common reaction is: "That wouldn't work."

The green set on the right represents all ideas that are in fact a good idea (that is, they could be the basis for a product that customers want and would pay for).

Not many people start off with ideas that sound absurd and are in fact absurd (the blue set on the left, excluding the intersect). That's good news, because the world doesn't need any more perpetual-motion-machine inventors.

However, many people tend to come up with ideas that are perfectly good, but are very obvious (the green set on the right, excluding the intersect). There's a good chance that many startups are working on a similar idea.

Keep in mind that it's fine to have some competitors, because this validates that the opportunity exists and that there are customers who are looking for this solution. However, having many direct competitors is a tough starting point for any startup, particularly if those competitors are further along in their product development and have significant capital to maintain their market lead.

Some of the best startup ideas exist in the intersection between these two sets. They're both a good idea (the green set) and non-obvious (the blue set). These startup ideas are counterintuitive to most people. Generally, these ideas are only visible to those with deep insights into the problem space, often acquired over long periods of time.

If most people think your startup idea won't work, but you have some unique insight that convinces you that they're wrong and you're right, then you could be onto something.

### Case study: Airbnb

When Airbnb started, many smart people looked at the idea and said: "There's no way people will give their house keys to a stranger and let them stay in their house just to make a few extra bucks. It won't work, at least not at scale."

Of course, today we know that Airbnb is a wildly successful tech company. The founders' unique insights gave them the ability to see past this objection and pursue a business model that most people thought wouldn't be viable.

### Task: Research your competitors

Imagine you're trying to raise money from a venture capital fund and you send them your pitch deck. One of the first things they'll do is consider the competitive landscape and make an assessment as to whether your startup is doing anything new, or at least different than existing competitors.

Now, put yourself in the shoes of the analyst at that fund. Spend half an hour doing some online research on your company's problem space and see how many competitors you can find. Don't just look for direct competitors that are doing the same thing, but also indirect competitors that might provide an alternative solution to the same problem.

Does your startup stand out as doing something new and innovative, or does it appear to be one of a large number of undifferentiated competitors?

## The right team

It's fine to be a sole founder at the outset, but before long most founders realize that having a team is critical to the success of their company.

The amount of work needed to build and launch a startup is massive, and it's been shown that sole founders struggle to cope with the workload.

Furthermore, startups also need a range of skill sets and perspectives, and just about every founder benefits from the moral support of being part of a team. Having people you trust as thought-leadership partners within the team can help you to weather the inevitable emotional ups and downs of establishing a startup. The team helps you build the resiliency necessary to get through the most challenging periods. Moreover, these individuals can provide different approaches to problem solving that will ultimately contribute to faster progress.

### Task: Complete a startup skills checklist

Complete the following startup skills checklist to see how your team stacks up. There's no absolutely right mix of skills, but if you find there's an obvious gap, now is a good time to start working on filling it.

☐ More than one founder  
☐ Diverse backgrounds and perspectives  
☐ Domain expertise relevant to the target market  
☐ Tech skills suited to building the product  
☐ Design skills  
☐ Sales skills  
☐ Communication skills  
☐ Leadership skills  

## Intense customer pain

You might have heard of "painkiller" companies versus "vitamin" companies. Painkillers are the ones that are solving a significant pain for customers, whereas vitamin companies are making products that might be useful but are more of a "nice to have" than a "need to have."

The benefit of being a painkiller company is that your target customers are probably looking for a solution to whatever problem is causing them the pain. Maybe they've tried other products, or even invested time and money trying to create their own solution.

A useful way to think of customer pain is with reference to intensity versus frequency. Problems that are intense are more likely to cause customers to actively seek new possible solutions than problems that are mild. Similarly, problems that occur frequently are better motivators than problems that only occur very occasionally.

If you're looking at a number of customer pain points that you could address, try plotting them on a chart with intensity and frequency on the axes. The problems in the top right quadrant (high intensity, high frequency) are likely to be the best ones to go after.

![Chart that shows the relationship between the intensity and frequency of pain.]

## Scalable business model

Successful startups tend to be highly scalable, meaning that they can grow rapidly. Scalable startups can become increasingly efficient in terms of resource requirements as they deliver their product to an expanding customer base.

If your business model relies on having to perform repetitive, non-scalable tasks (even doing in-person sales calls), you might face major barriers to scalability and growth. That's because these constraints might place an upper limit on the number of customers you can serve.

The following simple graph illustrates a non-scalable company that's delivering services to customers. Let's say it's a graphic-design business. As the company gets more customers, it does more graphic design work and generates more revenue. At the same time, however, it needs to employ more graphic designers, so its costs increase proportionally. At some point, it stops growing and its revenues and costs plateau. As long as revenues exceed costs the business is making a profit, which is of course a good thing. However, this isn't what scalability looks like.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/startup/fundamentals/media/learning-path-not-scalable.png)

Now let's look at a scalable business model.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/startup/fundamentals/media/learning-path-scalable.png)

In a scalable company, at some point revenues become decoupled from costs. For many companies, this is because they're taking advantage of the inherent scalability of the internet.

If your product is software or something that can be achieved through software, after your product is built, the incremental cost of digitally delivering your product to each additional customer is very close to zero.

After you've built the product and invested in developing and launching it, a scalable business model enables your company to grow rapidly.

## Large opportunity

The success of a startup is a function of volume and value; volume being the number of customers it can serve, and value represented by what those customers are willing to pay for the startup's product or service. Volume and value in turn dictate the economic rent the company is able to capture, and the overarching size of the market the startup could potentially address.

Startup founders should aim to serve as large a market as possible and ensure that their product creates meaningful value for customers.

As noted by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape and cofounder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, "software is eating the world." Every industry is being disrupted by software companies, resulting in massive shifts of economic value from old, legacy companies to new, digitally enabled ones. There are countless opportunities to build companies capable of disrupting multibillion-dollar markets, so why create a company that's serving a narrow niche or focused just on a small market?

> **Tip**
> 
> Ask yourself: Am I focused on a large and growing market? Are there enough people who will rely on my product every day to make this an opportunity worth pursuing? Is this a market that's dominated by large, inefficient incumbents who could be disrupted by my solution?
> 
> Remember that you could be devoting the next 10 years of your life to this company, so the prize had better be worth the effort!

## Timing

There's an optimal time for every startup idea. Make sure that you're not launching your startup too far ahead of the opportunity, or too far behind.

An example of launching too far ahead of the opportunity would be a marketplace for sharing quantum computing capability. Quantum computing is going to be a huge opportunity at some point, but it might not be wise to set up a marketplace for sharing that capability today; you'd be some years ahead of the curve.

Conversely, you'd be a brave person to start an online bookstore company today. The optimal time for starting that business has passed.

### Task: Identify timing factors

Make a note of any factors you can think of that affect the timing of your company. Is now a good time for this idea? Why?

## Tailwinds

On a related note, the best ideas often benefit from tailwinds that help push them along. These are shifts in technology, consumer behavior, or regulations that make it easier to get your startup started (or that make it possible, if it would've previously been impossible).

Uber benefited from tailwinds when it launched in 2009. The founders had identified a growing acceptance of the sharing economy by consumers, as well as the emergence of ubiquitous GPS and high-quality maps on smartphones (noting that the first iPhone was released in 2007).

Had someone tried to launch a ridesharing app like Uber five years earlier, it wouldn't have made sense. Similarly, if someone were to start another rideshare company today, it would face stiff competition from existing ridesharing apps that have already established traction, market share, and a strong brand.

### Task: Identify tailwinds

Make a note of all of the tailwinds you can think of that might benefit your company. What can you do now to capitalize on them?

## Inherently shareable

The cheapest way to acquire a new customer is by having an existing customer refer someone else to your product.

A large proportion of successful startups deliberately built features that make it easy for users to share their product, and this shareability contributed to their massive growth.

Hotmail is a great example. The company started in 1996, and at that time was just about the first browser-based email service. Browser-based email is ubiquitous and free today, but in 1996, in the early days of the internet, nearly everyone's email address was tied to their ISP. That was inconvenient because if you changed your ISP, you had to change your email address.

Hotmail decided to make their product shareable by putting a footer at the bottom of every email that read "Sent from Hotmail. Get your free email here." The result of this shareability was that many people got a Hotmail address.

Over the course of a year and a half after launching, Hotmail grew from zero users to 9 million users, and was subsequently acquired in late 1997 by Microsoft for a reported $450 million. (For more information, check out Microsoft Acquires Hotmail, List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft, and How Hotmail changed Microsoft (and email) forever.) Today, 9 million users doesn't seem like much, because there are billions of people on the internet; but in 1997, this represented around one out of every eight internet users.

### Task: Find ways to share your product

Make a note of the five software products that you use most often. See if you can find a way that each of them has been deliberately designed to be shareable. Does the company give existing users an incentive to share the product with new users? Do you think this has contributed to the company's growth?

Think about what features can you build into your product from the beginning that will make it easy to share. How can you provide users an incentive to share it?

## Recurring revenues

Unlike one-off sales, recurring revenues occur on a regular, ongoing basis. For example, software-as-a-service businesses that bill customers through a subscription agreement generate recurring revenues. With this type of business model, as long as the customer continues using your product and paying for it, you'll continue making money.

Recurring revenues are highly attractive because:

- They can lead to a high customer lifetime value (LTV).
- The cost to retain an existing customer is almost always lower than the cost to acquire a new customer.
- Revenues are predictable as long as you have a high level of customer retention.
- Predictable revenues enable more confidence in investing in product development, often leading to better products over time.
- Companies that generate recurring revenues can scale much more rapidly.
- Investors are usually more interested in businesses that generate recurring revenues than those that make one-off sales, because each new customer is building cumulatively on an existing revenue base.
- Customers often prefer to spread the cost of your product over a monthly billing cycle rather than having to pay for it up front.
- You can make money while you sleep!

### Task: Find ways to make revenue recurring

Open your smartphone or your laptop. Make a note of all the products to which you've subscribed and that you're continuing to pay for on an ongoing basis.

> **Tip**
> 
> Ask yourself: Why do I continue to pay for this product? Look at the communications you've received from the company to see what they've done to ensure they retain you as a paying customer.
> 
> Are there any lessons that you can apply in your own startup?

## Worksheet

In this unit, we've discussed nine shared attributes of successful companies. You can score your company based on the presence or absence of those attributes.

Don't be concerned if you don't get all nine. By completing the remaining modules in the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub, you'll have an opportunity to address any areas where your startup is currently lacking.

☐ Based on a non-obvious idea  
☐ Founded by the right team  
☐ Addresses intense customer pain  
☐ Has a scalable business model  
☐ Represents a large market opportunity  
☐ Benefits from advantageous timing  
☐ Takes advantage of market tailwinds  
☐ Has an inherently shareable product  
☐ Has a business model based on recurring revenues

# What makes startups fail?

The unfortunate reality is that most startups fail. The good news is that in many cases, these common causes of failure are avoidable. As long as founders are aware of the most common startup pitfalls, they can take steps to mitigate situations before they worsen.

Bear in mind that your startup failing doesn't need to spell the end of your entrepreneurial career! Failing can be a great opportunity to learn what customers really want. Moreover, if the failure happens quickly and cheaply, you can pick yourself up and move onto another idea, applying the lessons you learned from your first attempt.

In this unit, you learn about the most common causes of startup failure, and some of the relatively simple actions you can take (or avoid taking) in the early days to maximize the chances of your startup being successful.

At the end of this unit, you can work through a checklist to score your startup against the indicators of startup failure. This list helps you identify any issues that you might need to address.

## Building a product that nobody wants

By far the most common reason that startups fail is they build products that nobody wants. In reality, nearly every startup can find someone who will use their product. However, it's essential that you find not only a common problem that people are having, but also that the problem is sufficiently intense or frequent for them. Such people will actively seek out a solution and pay for it.

Without proven demand from customers, it's likely that you'll build either entirely the wrong product or a product that's not exactly what your target customer needs. This prevents you from creating a viable, scalable business.

In another module, we discuss methods for validating your idea with customers before you spend significant amounts of time or money building your product. This is a vital step in confirming that customers want your product and that it solves a real problem for them.

## A derivative idea

Chances are you've encountered startups that are based on a derivative idea. These companies are modeled on successful existing products, but tweaked slightly to create something that's more useful to a narrower set of users or a narrower geography, or that has a slightly different feature set. In some cases, the startup is essentially an alternatively branded version of the original product with no substantive changes.

For example, derivative startups might include, say, a social network just for pet owners, a rideshare company that operates in one specific city, or a voice-chat product that's invite-only instead of open to anyone.

Often founders with derivative ideas believe that the market is big enough to accommodate multiple, similar competitors. It's true that startups based on derivative ideas can be successful, especially if the original idea has overlooked a certain segment of users by trying to cater to a very broad audience.

However, in most cases, startups based on derivative ideas have a tough time achieving real scale. It's usually not difficult to acquire some users and generate some revenue, but it's much more difficult to take significant market share from existing companies that already have product-market fit and a recognized brand.

A good example of derivative brands is the recent surge in "mattress-in-a-box" e-commerce companies. These companies produce mattresses, sell them via online stores, and ship them in space-saving, rolled-up packaging to customers. They don't have a physical retail presence. This is a fundamentally sound business model, because it enables the company to have lower overheads and lower prices than traditional retailers. This business model also provides a more convenient shopping experience for customers.

Casper was one of the first mattress-in-a-box startups. It launched in 2014 and rapidly gained traction in this $28 billion a year market. Over the following few years, more than a dozen mattress-in-a-box companies appeared, with varying degrees of differentiation against the original Casper business model.

The mattress market is large enough to accommodate multiple competitors, and it's true that a number of the mattress startups that followed Casper have been successful due to new product innovations.

However, with derivative ideas, there's a problem with diminishing returns. Being one of the first few entrants in a new business category can be great, but being the tenth or twentieth of these companies is pretty tough.

The previous unit of this module touched on the importance of technology tailwinds. It turns out that mattress-in-a-box startups all leveraged one crucial technology tailwind: the recent development of "roll-pack" machines. These machines enable mattresses to be produced and packed down into a small, easily transportable package. Without this new capability, none of these mattress-in-a-box startups would've been viable.

## Competing with free

Let's say you're going to create a product that allows people to do a certain task, and they're currently able to do that task by using something that's free and readily available. Examples of this particular scenario might include a spreadsheet or a Facebook group.

In these instances, you'll need to give potential users a compelling reason to use your product, because:

- You're asking them to stop using something that they're familiar with and that currently works for them, even if it's imperfect.
- You're asking them to try something new and learn how to use it.
- You're asking them to pay money for something that was previously free.

If you're competing with free, a good rule of thumb is that your product needs to be 10 times better than the free alternative. It's only by providing a massively improved experience that people will change their behavior.

> **Tip**
> 
> Ask yourself: How imperfect is the free solution that my target users are currently using? Can I greatly improve the way in which they complete the task? How can I make my product as simple as possible to learn and use? Are users more likely to use my product if I offer a free trial?

## Attempting to scale before achieving problem-solution fit

It can be extremely tempting for startup founders to double down on a product as soon as it acquires its first few customers, or generates the first few dollars of revenue.

However, attempting to scale a company based on a relatively weak signal from a small number of users is a risky strategy. These users might be exceptional, and might not represent the larger cohort of future users. Other, closely related products might serve a much larger adjacent market, but you just haven't identified that adjacent opportunity yet.

A helpful way to think about the early days of your startup is to adopt Steve Blank's definition:

"A startup is a temporary organization that's designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model."

A business model is a high-level plan for how the company will create, deliver, and capture value. It includes consideration of the customer, the value proposition, product or service, revenue streams, channels, activities, resources, partners, and costs. For a great primer on business models, reference the Business model canvas.

Although it seems counterintuitive, startup founders should set out to not build a business initially, and should resist the temptation to acquire users and make revenues. Instead, they should set out on a mission to search for a really good problem to solve, that's experienced by a large number of people, for which they could build a compelling solution, and around which they can build a scalable business model.

Achieving problem-solution fit is at the heart of this process. You'll know you've achieved problem-solution fit when customers tell you unequivocally that they care about the job your product can do for them, and that it would either alleviate a major pain point or create a significant gain for them.

Only when you have this evidence should you stop searching for the right business model and start executing on building your business.

When you're building a startup, you're by definition engaging in business-model innovation. You're trying a business model that no one else has tried before. It would be unreasonable to expect that from the very beginning, you know with certainty who your customers are, what product you should build for them, or how you're going to make money.

It's therefore helpful to think about the early stages of your startup as an opportunity to explore and experiment. Instead of locking in a plan, you should develop your ideas iteratively over a period of time. Engage with customers to inform your direction and ensure you're building a product they want, and around which you can build a successful business. We'll spend more time discussing how to validate your idea with customers in another module.

## Unnecessary secrecy

Many first-time founders are concerned that someone will steal their idea and use it to build a competing business. This fear leads to either keeping the idea a secret or asking people to sign a non-disclosure agreement before talking to them. Neither of these approaches is helpful for most startups.

The reality is that it's extremely rare for someone to copy another person's startup idea. In fact, in most cases the best thing you can do is tell everyone about your startup idea to get as much feedback as possible, especially from potential customers.

The real value in your startup comes from executing your idea. It relies on your unique combination of skills and insights coming together to create the best possible solution to the problem you're trying to solve.

There are plenty of reasons why it's generally better to tell people what you're working on rather than keep it a secret. Let's briefly discuss a few.

**Ideas are cheap and easy to come up with.** Millions of people in the world have startup ideas. Most of those ideas won't prove to be worthwhile. If you ask anyone who's even remotely interested in being an entrepreneur, chances are they already have multiple startup ideas that they're passionate about pursuing. Why would they want to devote years of their life working on something they didn't come up with, and that they're most likely not passionate about?

**The longer you keep your idea to yourself, the more you're depriving yourself of valuable feedback.** You should take every opportunity to tell people about your idea and find out if it meets a need. Don't just tell your friends or family, because they'll most likely give you well-meaning (but unhelpful) positive feedback. The best feedback comes from potential customers, followed by experienced founders, mentors, and investors who can share their advice and insights.

**Talking about your startup idea is a great way to attract cofounders and collaborators,** particularly if you're part of an existing startup community and can take part in networking opportunities and pitch events. By sharing your vision and passion, you're more likely to find others who can join you and contribute to your startup journey.

**If you want to raise money from investors, you have to be able to talk openly about what you're working on.** Good investors are highly protective of their reputations, and there's no sense in an investor stealing your idea. They have better things to do with their time, and the feedback you'll get from good investors more than outweighs any risk there might be in talking to them about your idea.

Very few investors will sign a non-disclosure agreement before you tell them about your startup. Asking them to sign one generally doesn't go over well.

> **Important**
> 
> If you intend to file a patent application to protect your idea, then publicly disclosing it before you file can jeopardize your ability to get a patent. If patent protection is relevant to your startup, then it's a good idea to get advice from a patent attorney before disclosing anything publicly.

## Not seeking out the right advice

One of the best things you can do in the early days of your startup is to seek out advice from people with deep startup experience. These people can include experienced founders, angel or venture-capital investors, and people who've run startup incubators and accelerators.

These folks might be able to provide advice that will shorten your learning curve, make useful connections and introductions, and prevent you from wasting time and money going down the wrong path.

Their advice is almost always going to be more valuable than the advice you'll receive from another first-time founder, your accountant (unless they specialize in startups), or your friend who works in a corporate job and has never founded a startup.

One of the reasons first-time founders fail to get advice from the right people is they assume that successful founders and investors are hard to pin down and unlikely to give you their time. Successful founders are certainly busy, but many of them have benefited from the guidance of experienced founders who've come before them. Startup ecosystems have a strong pay-it-forward ethos, and you might be surprised at how easily you can tap into the experience of some very successful founders simply by asking good questions.

Similarly, investors are always on the lookout for promising startups. Good investors will generally take a meeting with a pre-launch startup founder, as long as they can see that you're working on something that fits their investment mandate. They also like to feel that you're seeking their advice, not just pitching them. As the old adage goes, "If you want money, ask for advice; if you want advice, ask for money."

### Task: Identify potential connections

Make a wish list of people with whom you'd like to connect. Start with your local startup community, but also look further afield. Reach out through mutual contacts, by using LinkedIn, or by sending an email or direct message. Have a specific question that you believe that individual is well-positioned to address; nobody likes to hear "I just want to pick your brains!"

## Cofounder conflict

Disagreement among cofounders is unfortunately a common cause of startup failure.

Disagreements by themselves are a normal part of building a business. However, it's important that cofounders have a sufficiently robust relationship, and the right processes in place to deal effectively with disagreements. They must be able to discuss difficult issues and reach agreement without causing irreparable harm to their working relationships, and to the company.

Cofounder conflict can be particularly acute if any or all of the following conditions are true:

- The founders haven't worked together before.
- They have different levels of commitment to the company (both time and financial).
- They have different financial needs.
- There's a lack of clarity about the respective roles that each will play in the business.

> **Tip**
> 
> Ask yourself: Do the cofounders know each other sufficiently well? Have they developed an ability to work through difficult discussions and reach agreement? Is there any misalignment of interests? If you haven't already, review the Founder Alignment Worksheet we discussed in Should you found a startup? and use it as an input to this process.

## Worksheet

In this unit, we've discussed seven factors that can be early indicators of eventual startup failure. These are only indicators, and of course they don't mean that your startup is definitely going to fail, nor are they an exhaustive list of all the things that can go wrong in your startup. However, they're a good starting point for identifying some of the most common mistakes made in early-stage startups.

Complete the following checklist to score your startup against these seven indicators. The ideal outcome is to get as low a score as possible. If you get zero, that's fantastic, but don't be concerned if you answer "yes" to some. By completing the remaining modules in the Founders Hub, you'll have an opportunity to explore ways to "un-fail" your startup by addressing any issues that you've identified.

☐ I might be building a product that nobody wants.  
☐ My idea seems like a derivative idea.  
☐ I'm going to be competing with free.  
☐ I've been attempting to scale before achieving problem-solution fit.  
☐ I'm too concerned about secrecy.  
☐ I haven't been seeking out the right advice.  
☐ My cofounder(s) and I haven't addressed how to manage disagreements.  

**Score: __ / 7**

Finally, bear in mind that as well as these indicators of failure, you should be thinking about the attributes of successful startups, as discussed in the previous unit. The absence of those positive attributes is just as much a concern as the presence of these indicators of failure.

# Summary

This module provided you with:
- A short introduction to some core startup concepts.
- A discussion of some personal considerations to help you make decisions about how to allocate your time and effort.
- An examination of some of the attributes of successful and unsuccessful companies.

We worked through a founder-alignment exercise to make sure you and your cofounders are on the same page. You also now have two checklists that hopefully will prove useful to you. One checklist helps you identify attributes of successful startups and integrate them into your company. The other checklist helps you identify indicators of failure and avoid making mistakes that could cause your company to fail.

Here's a short list of conclusions you can draw from this module:

- **Consider the motivations and risk tolerance of each cofounder early in the journey.** This helps you get an informed view of what's ahead. It also provides an opportunity to address any misalignment of expectations before they become problematic.

- **Validate your startup idea before committing full-time.** Your objective should be to de-risk the opportunity as much as possible, and to make commitments of time and money in step with this de-risking process.

- **Your most important job in the beginning is to find a repeatable, scalable business model.** Resist the temptation to try acquiring users or generating revenue until you have strong evidence that your idea addresses a real pain point. You must have a clear understanding of the needs of your target users and what product they need you to build.

- **By understanding the shared attributes of successful startups, you can integrate those attributes into your startup from the very beginning.**

- **Many startups fail because the founders make predictable and avoidable mistakes.** By understanding some of the most common startup pitfalls, you're better able to avoid them and improve your startup's chances of success.
