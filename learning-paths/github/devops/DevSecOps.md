## DevSecOps defined

DevSecOps, which stands for development, security, and operations, is a framework that integrates security into all phases of the software development lifecycle. Organizations adopt this approach to reduce the risk of releasing code with security vulnerabilities. Through collaboration, automation, and clear processes, teams share responsibility for security, rather than leaving it to the end when issues can be much more difficult and costly to address. DevSecOps is a critical component of a multicloud security strategy.

## DevSecOps versus DevOps

In traditional software development, projects are split into distinct phases for planning, design, development, integration, and testing, which happen sequentially over several months or even years. Although this approach is very methodical, many organizations have found it to be too slow, making it difficult to meet customers' expectations for continuous product improvements. Additionally, security typically gets bolted on at the very end, which puts companies at risk of a breach.

To remain competitive, many companies have adopted a DevOps model that prioritizes delivery of smaller packets of high-quality code rather than feature-rich projects that take longer. In this framework, software development and operations teams collaborate to incorporate testing and integration throughout the process. Automation, standardized processes, and collaboration help teams move quickly without sacrificing quality.

DevSecOps is an enhancement to DevOps that builds security into all aspects of the process. The goal is to address security issues from the very start of the project. In this framework, not only does the entire team take responsibility for quality assurance and code integration but also security. In practice, this means teams discuss security implications during planning and begin testing for security issues in development environments, rather than waiting until the end. Another name for this approach is shift left security.

## Why is DevSecOps Important?

There are many methods that attackers use to gain access to an organization's data and assets, but a common tactic is to exploit software vulnerabilities. These types of breaches are costly, time consuming, and depending on the severity, damaging to a company's reputation. The DevSecOps framework reduces the risk of deploying software with misconfigurations and other vulnerabilities that bad actors can take advantage of.

## Key Components of DevSecOps

A successful DevSecOps process includes the following components:

### Continuous integration

With continuous integration developers commit their code to a central repository multiple times a day. Then the code is automatically integrated and tested. This approach enables teams to catch integration issues and bugs early in the process rather than waiting until the end when there could be several issues that need to be resolved.

### Continuous delivery

Continuous delivery builds upon continuous integration to automate the process of moving code from the build environment to a staging environment. Once in staging, in addition to unit testing, the software is automatically tested to ensure the user interface is working, the code is successfully integrated, that APIs are reliable, and that the software can handle the expected traffic volumes. The goal of this approach is to consistently deliver production-ready code that provides value to customers.

### Continuous security

Building security into the entire software development lifecycle is a key component of DevSecOps. This includes threat modeling early in the process and automated security testing throughout the entire lifecycle, starting with developers' own environments. By thoroughly testing the software for security issues early and frequently, organizations can efficiently deliver software with minimal issues.

### Communication and collaboration

DevSecOps is highly dependent on individuals and teams working closely together. Continuous integration requires people to collaborate to address conflicts in code, and teams need to effectively communicate to unify around the same goals.

## How to implement DevSecOps

Adding security to your DevOps process requires careful planning. Start slowly with processes that introduce the least friction for the team and offer the biggest security payoff. Here are a few ways to add security to a typical DevOps sprint.

### Planning and development

Introducing security early into development sprints not only helps reduce vulnerabilities later down the line, but it also saves time because it's easier to address issues before code has been built and integrated. During planning and development, use threat modeling to identify and mitigate potential threats to the application. This will help you build security into the application right from the start. To uncover security issues before code is committed to the shared repository, implement automated checks, such as integrated development environment security plugs-ins, which give developers immediate feedback if there's a potential security risk in the code they've written. During code review, have someone with security expertise provide recommendations for making improvements.

### Code commit

One of the keys to a successful DevSecOps process is continuous integration. Developers typically commit their code to a central repository several times a day to ensure integration issues are caught early. It's important to add automated security checks to this phase. This can include scanning third-party libraries and dependencies, unit testing, and static application security testing. It's also important to deploy role-based access controls to protect your continuous integration and continuous delivery infrastructure from attackers seeking to run malicious code or steal credentials.

### Building and testing

Running automated security scripts on the test environment helps uncover potential issues that weren't previously detected. Some of the security tests you can run during this phase include dynamic application security testing, infrastructure scanning, container scanning, cloud configuration validation, and security acceptance testing.

### Production

Once the application is deployed to production, some organizations engage in penetration testing to try to find weaknesses in the live environment. In penetration testing, people adopt the mindset of an attacker and search for ways to breach the application.

### Operation

Even the best DevSecOps process won't catch everything, so it's critical to continuously monitor applications for vulnerabilities and threats. Analytics data can help you evaluate if your security posture is improving and highlight areas for optimization.

## DevSecOps Tools and Technologies

When choosing security tools, it's important to select ones that work well with your current DevOps technology. This will make it easier to incorporate security into your entire process. The following are a few of the types of tools you may need:

### Infrastructure as code scanning

To improve their efficiency, DevSecOps teams typically use open source tools like Terraform to manage and provision infrastructure like networks, virtual machines, and load balancers through code rather than doing it manually. Terraform helps ensure that infrastructure is set up and updated consistently across hundreds or thousands of servers. To reduce the risk that misconfigurations are deployed to the production environment, infrastructure as a code scanning tools automatically check the infrastructure at the code level for noncompliance with security policies and standards.

### Static application security testing

Before their code is compiled, DevSecOps developers begin testing their custom code for security vulnerabilities. This helps them fix issues without affecting the build. Static application security testing tools make this process easier with automatic checks and real-time feedback. Many tools identify exactly which code is risky and offer suggested fixes.

### Software composition analysis

One way that teams build applications and features more efficiently is by using third-party plug-ins and frameworks. These prebuilt tools save time, but they may also introduce risks, such as issues with the licensing, poorly written code, or security vulnerabilities. Software composition analysis tools identify open source components in applications and evaluate them against proprietary or free databases to detect license violations and security and quality issues.

### Interactive application security testing

During quality assurance testing or when an application is being used, interactive application security tools scan the code to find vulnerabilities and provide reports that identify where in the code the issue is.

### Dynamic application security testing

Dynamic application security testing emulates the methods a bad actor might use to attack an application. This testing occurs while the application is running and is based on predefined use cases.

### Container scanning

Containers are widely used in DevSecOps because they help developers easily deploy self-contained units of code. Within a container is a container image that includes the code that runs processes for the container. However, these images are often built using existing images or pulled from public repositories. Container scanning tools, scan containers and compare them against public or proprietary vulnerability databases to uncover potential security issues.

## DevSecOps Best Practices

DevSecOps is as much about culture change as process and tools. Here are some best practices to help make adopting this framework as smooth as possible.

### Shift the culture

Recognize that people may have a difficult time changing the way they work, and conflicts may arise. To help them adapt, clearly communicate the organization's goals and expectations, provide lots of opportunities for open dialog, and anticipate that you'll need to be flexible until teams find the tools, process, and cadence that work best for them.

### Define requirements and metrics

Establish a minimum-security baseline. For guidance refer to industry and regulatory requirements or The Open Worldwide Application Security Project® (OWASP) Top Ten critical risks to web applications and the SANS Top 25 software errors. Once you've defined requirements, determine which metrics you want to track to help you monitor your progress.

### Start small

Security automation tools offer many options for checking code for issues, but turning them all on, especially early in your adoption of DevSecOps, may overwhelm your team. Be judicious about which tools you implement and how many issues you scan for.

### Perform threat modeling

Develop a threat modeling process, which can be as simple or as detailed and technical as you need it to be. Use this approach to document a realistic security view of your application that includes:

- How attackers can abuse the application's design.
- How to fix vulnerabilities.
- Priority of different issues.

### Implement automation

Automation is key to enabling both quality and speed in the DevSecOps process. By embedding automated security scans during all phases of the continuous integration and continuous delivery lifecycle, you'll be able to improve the security of your applications without significantly slowing down the process.

### Manage dependencies

Most developers use third-party packages and libraries to efficiently build applications. The problem is that some of these solutions have security flaws, and developers aren't always diligent about keeping them up to date. To reduce your risk, make sure the components you use are vetted for security risks and develop a standardized process for updating them.

### Evaluate and improve

Regularly assess how the process is working and adjust as needed to ensure your organization is meeting its goals. A no-blame post-mortem after the completion of a sprint can help uncover opportunities for improvement. Analytics data and threat intelligence can also help you determine if there are security needs that aren't being met by your current approach.

## DevSecOps for cloud-native applications

Cloud-native applications are architected for the cloud and are usually vendor neutral, allowing them to be ported from one cloud to another. Designed to be highly scalable and resilient, development teams typically build them using microservices, containers, and automation, making them ideally suited for a DevSecOps process. Building continuous security, continuous integration, and continuous delivery into the development process for cloud-native applications enables scalability without compromising on security. Cloud security posture management (CSPM) solutions, like Microsoft Defender Security Posture Management, discover and address misconfigurations and vulnerabilities across your environment to help you secure your code and the entire DevOps pipeline. Once you've deployed your application to the cloud, cloud workload protection platforms (CWPP) help safeguard them and the underlying data by detecting and mitigating threats to workloads across multicloud environments.

## Multicloud security defined

To understand multicloud security, it's important to know what multicloud and hybrid cloud services are. Multicloud refers to the use of cloud services from multiple cloud service providers. With multicloud, your business can oversee separate projects in different cloud environments from several cloud service providers.

Like multicloud, a hybrid cloud uses multiple cloud environments. However, in a hybrid cloud setup, work is distributed in a shared workload system across a public cloud, on-premises resources, and a private cloud.

One benefit of both hybrid cloud and multicloud is their adaptability and cost effectiveness. Both allow for more flexibility when managing assets and data migrations between on-premises resources and the cloud. Additionally, businesses have the benefit of more control and security with a private cloud in a hybrid cloud environment.

"Multicloud security" is a solution that helps protect your business assets—such as private customer data and applications—against cyberattacks across your cloud environments.

## Why is multicloud security important?

Unfortunately, cyberattacks are now a common and increasingly serious threat to most businesses because of the reputational damage and financial loss they can cause. Data leaks and security breaches are also harmful to the continuity of your organization.

As more industries adopt multicloud and hybrid cloud infrastructures, they face the exposure risks that come with any unprotected cloud environment. Unprotected cloud environments often face increased exposure to data loss, unauthorized access, lack of visibility across multiple cloud environments, and increased noncompliance. A single cyberattack can negatively affect your business and lead to customer mistrust, costly repairs, and loss of revenue.

Any multicloud strategy should include a multicloud security solution to help protect against these damaging consequences. Here are four benefits of implementing multicloud security:

- **Increased reliability.** Multicloud security helps keep your business assets protected, so your data stays safer and your critical applications remain functioning optimally. With a more secure cloud, only authorized users have access to applications, which helps prevent any leaks of sensitive information.
- **Constant security.** With a more secure cloud environment, your business has round-the-clock monitoring of cyberattacks and exposure risks as well as reminders about key security updates.
- **Reduced costs.** Cyberattacks can have disastrous effects on your business, often resulting in expensive repairs and recovery. Securing your multicloud environment ensures that your business is better protected against the costly aftermath of cyberthreats.
- **Centralized visibility.** With a multicloud security solution, your business manages the security of your cloud environments from one location. Multicloud security allows you to view the health of your applications, assess any data or application exposure risks, and manage user access.

## Key considerations for multicloud security

Cloud environments have some unique challenges. With multicloud, the lack of visibility across cloud environments can make it challenging for your organization to monitor the health of its cloud infrastructures.

Therefore, when helping secure your cloud environments, consider the following:

- **The security posture of your cloud resources.** It's important to choose the most secure locations for your data, whether that be on premises or in the cloud. In addition, developing a business continuity and disaster recovery plan and using data loss prevention tools are essential to helping secure your cloud.
- **How to best protect cloud and hybrid workloads against threats.** To ensure that your business has the best visibility of what's happening in your cloud environments, use cloud security solutions that offer investigation, reporting, and threat detection, as well as those that help prevent cloud security threats.
- **Authentication.** Develop a strategy that allows your business to centralize policies for authentication and authorization. That way, no sole cloud service provider has completely different authentication and authorization protocols.
- **Updates.** Ensure that software updates are automated for individual cloud service providers to help avoid weak spots that cybercriminals can exploit.
- **Native security support.** Security platforms should reduce adoption resistance, not ask you to perform lengthy preparations for protection.
- **Centralized visibility.** Avoid a setup that requires you to jump back and forth between platforms to get a full picture of what's going on in your multicloud—this will save time and reduce frustration.

## How to manage multicloud security

Organizations are challenged by compliance obstacles and the lack of visibility across their cloud environments. Therefore, a centralized cloud security tool is essential to managing multicloud and hybrid cloud environments.

With a multicloud management platform, your organization can manage multicloud environments just like it would a single cloud environment. This can offer transparency and better control across cloud resources. In addition, your business receives useful analytics and AI functions from multicloud management solutions.

When using a multicloud management platform, follow these steps:

1. Secure your multicloud product development from the first piece of code.
2. Help protect the cloud service availability with network security.
3. Manage cloud infrastructure permissions and access for users.
4. Use Cloud Security Posture Management to monitor your cloud's posture and proactively remediate risks.
5. During runtime, use cloud workload protection.

## Types of multicloud security threats

In today's complex world of cyberthreats, many types of multicloud security threats exist. Here are a few common situations and obstacles to consider when forming a multicloud security plan:

- Lack of unified management and governance
- Silos, staffing constraints, and training gaps
- Protecting workloads regardless of where they're housed
- Lack of interoperability
- Misconfigurations or configuration drifts
- Lack of visibility across environments
- Maintaining consistent access controls
- Shadow IT
- Developing and operating secure apps

## Multicloud security best practices

Fortunately, organizations can prevent many multicloud security threats from ever surfacing by forming a security plan and adhering to some best practices:

- **Know your enemy.** By learning the most common ways that cybercriminals attempt to gain access to your cloud, you'll be able to proactively select the security solutions that best protect your organization from ever being breached.
- **Automate processes whenever possible.** When you turn on options for automatic updates, you'll have one less thing to think about and gain peace of mind knowing you have the latest patches in place.
- **Combine security incident and event management with extended detection and response to automate workload protection.** Get integrated threat protection across your devices, identities, apps, email, data, and cloud workloads.
- **Prioritize consistency.** As much as you're able, make uniform security decisions and settings across the cloud. Similarly, avoid one-off security decisions for specific situations that you'll need to track and manage differently going forward. This treats your multicloud as a cohesive ecosystem rather than one with many different rules and settings to remember and follow—which increases the risk of human error.
- **Use single-point-of-control management.** In this management style, your cloud engineers have the benefit of a sole control panel from which they can more easily oversee the security settings for your multicloud.
- **Enable least privilege access.** Automate least privilege policy enforcement consistently in your entire multicloud infrastructure to get a multidimensional view of your risk by identities, permissions, and resources.
- **Implement cloud security posture management (CSPM) recommendations.** Use a CSPM solution to assess and strengthen the security configuration of your cloud resources.
- **Reduce network redundancy.** The more places you have repeated information and resources, the more places cybercriminals have a chance at a breach.
- **Integrate security into DevOps.** Use a tool, such as Microsoft Defender for DevOps, to create secure apps by integrating directly into the developer workflow. You'll be able to address security risks earlier, automate vulnerability fixes, and enforce policies as code.

## How to choose a multicloud security solution

Ideally, a multicloud security solution will use a combination of measures to greatly reduce the likelihood that your cloud environment is compromised, such as:

- Finding weak spots across your cloud configuration.
- Implementing comprehensive multicloud support that covers all of your cloud environments.
- Using thorough workload protection that helps safeguard all of your different workloads.
- Deploying security intelligence that uses external attack surface management.
- Choosing native cloud security support.
- Creating centralized visibility across your environments.
- Having a plan in place to respond to threats in a timely manner.
- Determining what your false positive threat rate is.
- Ensuring you have compliance standards support.

For example, Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a multicloud security solution that works by:

- Assessing and strengthening the security configuration of your cloud resources.
- Managing compliance against critical industry and regulatory standards.
- Enabling threat protection for workloads running in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform—as well as for workloads that run on premises.
- Detecting vulnerabilities to help protect your multicloud and hybrid workloads against malicious attacks.

Although managing a more secure multicloud may initially seem overwhelming with many moving parts, the good news is that powerful solutions continue to evolve alongside any new malicious motives.

- [Find the right platform](#find-the-right-platform)

## Cyber threat intelligence defined

Digital transformation creates larger data estates, opening up new avenues of attack for cybercriminals. Bad actors' tactics are sophisticated and constantly evolving, making it difficult for companies to stay ahead of emerging threats. Cyber threat intelligence gives businesses the information and capabilities they need to continually refine their defenses.

Cyber threat intelligence is information that helps organizations better protect against cyberattacks. It includes data and analysis that give security teams a comprehensive view of the threat landscape so they can make informed decisions about how to prepare for, detect, and respond to attacks. Having focused information about actor behaviors, their tools and techniques, their exploits, the vulnerabilities they target, and emerging threats can help your organization prioritize its security efforts.

## How does threat intelligence work?

Threat intelligence platforms analyze large volumes of raw data about emerging or existing threats to help you make fast, informed cybersecurity decisions. A robust threat intelligence solution maps global signals every day, analyzing them to help you proactively respond to the ever-changing threat landscape.

A cyber threat intelligence platform uses data science to filter out false alarms and prioritize the risks that could cause real damage. That data comes from:

- Open-source threat intelligence (OSINT)
- Threat intelligence feeds
- In-house analysis

A simple threat data feed might provide you with information about recent threats, but it doesn't make sense of that unstructured data to determine which threats you're most vulnerable to or suggest a plan of action after a breach. That work would normally fall to human analysts.

A threat intelligence solution—ideally one with tools that use AI, machine learning, and advanced capabilities such as security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)—automates many security functions to help you preempt attacks, rather than merely react to them. Threat intelligence also enables security professionals to automate remediation actions when an attack is revealed, such as blocking malicious files and IP addresses.

## Why is threat intelligence important?

Threat intelligence is important because it helps organizations prioritize the strategies and tactics that will better protect them against a dynamic threat landscape. It's challenging to keep on top of the constant stream of information about emerging threats and decide what's relevant and actionable.

Threat intelligence, when combined with tools enriched with machine learning and automation such as security information and event management (SIEM) and extended detection and response (XDR), can enhance your threat detection and response efforts by:

- Unmasking your likely adversaries and their motivations.
- Exposing an adversary's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- Showing the different ways various attacks might affect your business.
- Identifying common indicators of compromise (IOCs) that signal an active breach.
- Suggesting a set of actions to take when you are attacked.
- Automatically blocking entire attacks.
- Informing your broader security strategies and workflows with rich threat data.

## Benefits of threat intelligence for security teams

Any business can improve its security posture with threat intelligence. It provides small and medium-sized businesses with the information they need to strategically defend themselves from ransomware and other risks. But security teams and executives in enterprises also have much to gain from threat intelligence.

In addition to better use of human skills and a faster threat response, threat intelligence solutions offer new efficiencies for people in many roles:

**Security and IT analysts:** Achieve and maintain network security.

**Cyber intelligence analysts:** Analyze threats against the organization and develop insights that will help them inform others about what threats are relevant.

**Security operations centers (SOCs):** Get context to assess threats and correlate them against other activity to determine the best and most effective response.

**Computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs):** Gain a deeper understanding of vulnerabilities, exploits against those vulnerabilities, and methods attackers use to breach systems.

**Executive managers:** Understand what threats are relevant to their organization so they can make data-based budget recommendations to their CEO and board.

## Types of threat intelligence

Threat intelligence can be broken down into four categories. Use them to help you decide who needs to receive what type of information:

### Strategic

Strategic threat intelligence is high-level analysis for non-technical stakeholders concerned with the overall business, such as C-suite executives, IT management, and boards of directors. Communicate this type of information in a broad context with the long term in view. These audiences must manage overall risks, such as how the general threat landscape is evolving, how a business decision might introduce new vulnerabilities, how advanced technology is helping businesses mitigate threats at a lower cost, or what the potential financial and operational implications of a breach are.

### Tactical

Tactical threat intelligence is information cybersecurity experts need to take immediate action to mitigate threats. It includes technical information about the most current TTP trends and IOCs, and is usually consumed by IT service managers, SOC center employees, and architects. Use this type of intelligence to make decisions about security controls and create proactive defense strategies. This type of information is always in flux and can be automated to help security teams maintain maximum agility.

### Operational

Operational threat intelligence is knowledge about specific threats and campaigns. It provides specialized information for incident response teams about an attacker's identity, motivations, and methods. Enable security professionals in your organization to receive this kind of intelligence more efficiently with a cyber threat intelligence platform that automates data collection, translating foreign-language sources when needed.

### Technical

Closely aligned with operational intelligence, technical threat intelligence refers to signs that an attack is happening—such as IOCs. Use a threat intelligence platform with AI to automatically scan for these types of known indicators, which can include phishing email content, malicious IP addresses, or specific implementations of malware. SOC and incident response teams can respond rapidly to this information and prevent damage to your business.

## Threat intelligence use cases

Deploy a cyber threat intelligence platform to make your security operations more efficient in a variety of ways.

### Manage alerts

Alert fatigue is a serious problem for SOC teams. They deal with massive numbers of alerts each day, and many are false positives. It's stressful and time-consuming to sort through all that data, and the sheer overwhelm can cause security team members to miss important threats. Alleviate those problems with a threat intelligence platform that helps burdened analysts prioritize alerts and incidents.

### Accelerate incident response

Cyber threat intelligence tools allow incident response teams to make informed decisions about how to contain and remediate threats in the quickest and most complete way, and then get the organization back to a secure state.

### Improve your security posture

Lean on a cyber threat intelligence platform to help you make short- and long-term decisions about your security investments based on your actual risk. A robust threat intelligence platform will help you create risk models and report to stakeholders throughout your organization about what your business's unique vulnerabilities are. Get a complete picture of your security posture to help your business decide where to invest its time and resources.

### Prevent fraud

Use threat intelligence tools to aggregate data from criminal communities and websites worldwide. Threat intelligence provides insights into the dark web and paste sites where criminals sell huge caches of compromised usernames, passwords, and banking data. A good cyber threat intelligence platform will monitor these sources around the clock and give you real-time alerts about the latest developments.

## Find the right threat intelligence platform

Threat intelligence solutions can improve your security posture by offering relevant insights into the threat landscape. Choose a platform that:

- Integrates with your existing systems and offers multi-platform and multi-cloud support to ensure you are protecting your entire IT estate.
- Uses automation to improve the quality of alerts and recommendations security teams receive.
- Has tools that present data in an easily digestible, visual format so you can share and discuss your security posture with stakeholders across your company.

## Frequently asked questions

**Expand all** | **Collapse all**

### What is an example of threat intelligence?

Some examples of threat intelligence are attacker identifiers, TTPs, common IOCs, malicious IP addresses, and many other indicators of known and emerging cyber threats. Threat intelligence software can collect and analyze these indicators and automatically block attacks or alert security teams to take further action.

### What are the key elements of cyber threat intelligence?

The key elements that make cyber threat intelligence platforms effective are threat data feeds that provide a complete view of the global threat landscape, advanced data analytics that automate risk prioritization, monitoring tools to identify common IOCs, and autogenerated alerts so security teams can remediate breaches quickly.

### How is threat intelligence collected?

Threat intelligence is collected from large volumes of raw data about emerging or existing threats. It's a result of scanning the internet and dark web for information about malicious actors and their tactics, as well as internal IOCs that signal a breach has already occurred. Trustworthy threat data feeds share information like attack signatures, bad IP addresses and domain names, and attacker TTPs. Threat intelligence platforms can make sense of all this raw data using AI and machine learning.

### What does a threat intelligence platform do?

A threat intelligence platform analyzes trillions of signals from the internet and maps them to tell you which threats are a serious risk to your business.

## Definition

### What is a cyberattack?

A cyberattack is a deliberate attempt by an individual or group to breach, damage, or disrupt computer systems, networks, or digital devices, often for malicious purposes such as data theft, espionage, financial fraud, or system sabotage.

Cyberattacks have evolved significantly over the years. In the 1980s to1990s, early viruses and worms emerged, primarily targeting individual computers and networks. In the 2000s, more sophisticated malware, phishing, and large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks appeared, targeting businesses and governments. In the 2010s, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), ransomware, and nation-state attacks became widespread. Today, attackers are using AI and cloud-based infrastructure to scale up their volume of attacks, launch sophisticated social engineering campaigns like deepfake scams, and tailor phishing lures and malware for individual targets, increasing their success rates.

Because our daily lives are so dependent on digital systems, cyberattacks pose significant risks to individuals, businesses, and governments. The rise of cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and AI has expanded the potential attack surface—or the set of all possible locations and entry points for accessing a network or system—making cybersecurity crucial to protecting sensitive data, financial assets, and even national security. As cyber threats continue to evolve, proactive defense strategies, threat intelligence, and cybersecurity awareness are more critical than ever.

Cyberattacks have the potential to severely damage the reputation of individuals and organizations, leading to a loss of trust and credibility. When sensitive data is breached, such as customer information, financial records, or proprietary business strategies, stakeholders might lose confidence in an organization's ability to protect their assets. High-profile breaches, like those affecting major corporations and government institutions, often result in public scrutiny, legal consequences, and financial losses. For individuals, identity theft or hacked social media accounts might tarnish personal and professional reputations.

Understanding cyberattacks and their evolving nature is crucial in strengthening cybersecurity measures and enabling businesses and individuals to implement proactive defenses, mitigate risks, and maintain trust.

## Types

### Different types of cyberattacks

Cybercriminals use a variety of attack methods to exploit system vulnerabilities, steal sensitive information, and disrupt operations.

There are two primary types of attacks:

**Commodity-based attacks.** In this type of attack, cybercriminals use an automated script and tool to send out an attack to a wide group of people. One example might be a phishing email sent out to a large number of email addresses. These attacks are generally not targeting a specific organization and attackers do not follow up on them if they fail.

**Human-operated or hands-on-keyboard attacks.** These types of attacks appear similar to a commodity-based attack, in that they may start off with a phishing email or credential theft. However, in this case, a real person is operating behind the scenes to craft a more targeted initial access attempt and follow up with hands-on-keyboard activity.

Attackers will typically target a specific business, organization, or government group. They use multiple methods to try to break in to an organization's systems or to cause damage after they have gained access, including:

**Brute-force attacks.** These attacks involve systematically guessing passwords or encryption keys to breach accounts and networks. After gaining entry to a system, an attacker might then follow up by installing malware or ransomware.

**DDoS attacks.** By overwhelming servers or networks with excessive traffic, cyberattackers cause service disruptions and render services unavailable.

**Malware.** Malware is a malicious piece of software that is often used to gain a foothold in the network by disabling security controls, providing remote access, or installing ransomware payloads.

**Ransomware.** Cyberattackers deploy a type of malware that encrypts files and essentially holds them hostage. The attacker then demands payment for decryption.

**Botnets.** This type of attack entails using networks of compromised computers to perform large-scale attacks, including spam distribution and DDoS attacks.

**Cross-site scripting (XSS).** To compromise user sessions and data, attackers inject malicious scripts into websites.

**SQL injection.** Exploiting database vulnerabilities by inserting malicious SQL queries, SQL injection attacks give attackers access to sensitive information or corrupt victims' databases.

**Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks.** Also called eavesdropping attacks, these attacks involve intercepting communications between two people or between a person and a server. MiTM attacks are often carried out on unsecured public wireless networks.

## Prevention

### How to prevent cyberattacks in today's complex digital estates

Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, making it crucial for businesses to implement proactive security measures. The following are key strategies to prevent cyberattacks.

**Implement strong authentication to protect identities.** Setting authentication strength allows system administrators to specify which combinations of authentication methods can be used to access a resource. For example, to access a sensitive resource, administrators might require that only phishing-resistant authentication methods be used. To access a less sensitive resource, administrators might allow less secure multifactor authentication combinations, such as a password plus a text message.

**Use passkeys.** Passkeys help prevent cyberattacks by replacing traditional passwords with cryptographic authentication, making them resistant to phishing, credential theft, and brute-force attacks. Since passkeys are tied to a user's device and require biometric authentication or a PIN, they eliminate the risks associated with password reuse and weak credentials.

**Update systems and software regularly.** Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software, so it's important to update operating systems and applications regularly. Where possible, turn on automatic updates. Regularly apply security patches for applications like Adobe, Java, and web browsers.

**Implement continuous threat exposure management.** Threat exposure management or security exposure management gives you a unified view of your organization's security posture across your assets and workloads. This helps to proactively manage attack surfaces, protect critical assets, and explore and mitigate exposure risk.

**Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.** Perform penetration testing to identify weaknesses before hackers do. Monitor network and system logs, and use a security information and event management (SIEM) system to detect anomalies.

**Review access controls and permissions.** Limit access to sensitive data and critical systems to authorized personnel only. Implement role-based access control (RBAC).

**Provide regular cybersecurity training.** Educate employees about phishing attacks, social engineering, and safe browsing practices. Teach them how to identify suspicious emails, links, and attachments, and how to respond if they receive any of these items. Run simulated phishing tests to test employee awareness.

**Implement detection and response tools.** Extended detection and response (XDR) tools unify threat detection, investigation, and response across cloud workloads, endpoints, and networks—supporting faster, more coordinated threat mitigation. By aggregating and analyzing security signals from multiple sources, XDR provides deep visibility into cloud environments and helps reduce dwell time for advanced threats.

**Use AI for cybersecurity.** Choosing tools with AI for cybersecurity is essential because AI detects and respond to threats in real time, helping to prevent cyberattacks before they cause damage. AI also improves security by analyzing vast amounts of data quickly, identifying patterns that human analysts might miss.

**Implement a managed detection and response (MDR) service.** An MDR is a cybersecurity service that helps proactively protect organizations from cyberthreats using advanced detection and rapid incident response. MDR services include a combination of technology and human expertise to perform cyberthreat hunting, monitoring, and response.

**Use a threat intelligence solution.** A cyber threat intelligence solution—ideally one with tools that use AI, machine learning, and advanced capabilities such as security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)—automates many security functions to help you preempt attacks, rather than merely react to them. Threat intelligence also helps security professionals automate remediation actions when an attack is revealed, such as blocking malicious files and IP addresses.

## Mitigation

### How to mitigate the effects of a cyberattack

If a cyberattack is detected, swift action is crucial to mitigate damage, contain the breach, and recover operations. After an attack, follow these key steps:

**Contain the damage.** Remove compromised computers, servers, or network segments from the network to prevent further spread. Unplug Ethernet cables, disable wireless networks, or use firewall rules to contain the attack. Disable compromised accounts and credentials, and reset passwords for affected accounts. Revoke access tokens and API keys if necessary. Use firewall rules to block connections from known attacker IPs, and shut down any unauthorized remote access sessions.

**Reach out to your managed service provider.** Many companies offer assistance in the case of a security breach. If you have a managed service provider to assist your internal team, contact them as soon as possible.

**Identify the type of attack.** Look for unexpected system behavior, unauthorized access, or ransom demands. Determine if it's malware, ransomware, phishing, DDoS, or data breach.

**Determine if data was compromised.** Review logs for unauthorized access attempts. Check if sensitive customer, financial, or proprietary information was stolen. If it's necessary to restore data, use clean, unaffected backups to perform the restore. Verify backups are free from malware before redeploying.

**Assess system integrity.** Identify which systems or applications were affected. Look for file changes, deleted records, or altered permissions. Identify malicious processes and shut them down to prevent further damage. Remove malware and unauthorized access. Use updated antivirus and antimalware tools to scan and clean infected devices. Reset system configurations and remove unauthorized accounts.

**Notify internal teams and authorities.** Report the incident to IT, security teams, executives, and legal teams. If personal data was compromised, notify regulatory bodies—such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), PCI-DSS compliance bodies—as required by law.

**Preserve evidence for forensic analysis.** Don't delete logs or restart systems immediately. Take system snapshots and log files for further investigation.

**Patch vulnerabilities and strengthen security.** Apply the latest security patches and software updates. Review firewall rules, email security settings, and access controls.

**Conduct a post-incident review.** Identify root causes and document lessons learned. Determine what security measures failed and how to improve them.

### Why you need a robust incident response plan

An incident response plan is essential for minimizing downtime and financial loss by reducing operational disruptions and preventing revenue loss. It also supports regulatory compliance, as many industries require a documented incident response plan to meet standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, NIST, and PCI-DSS. A well-executed response plan also protects your reputation and helps retain customer trust by supporting quick containment of threats, and preventing data leaks and brand damage. It enhances preparedness and response time by allowing teams to react swiftly and efficiently when a breach occurs. Furthermore, continuous review and improvement of the incident response plan strengthen an organization's security posture, helping to prevent future attacks.

## Emerging trends

### New and emerging trends in cyberattacks

Cyberattacks have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond individual businesses, significantly impacting the world economy. Large-scale attacks on financial institutions, supply chains, and critical infrastructure might result in billions of dollars in losses, disrupting industries and slowing economic growth. For example, ransomware attacks on healthcare systems or manufacturing plants lead to operational shutdowns, delayed services, and increased costs. Small businesses, often less equipped to handle cyberthreats, might suffer irreparable financial damage, leading to job losses and reduced market confidence. The rising cost of cybersecurity measures forces companies and governments to allocate more resources toward defense rather than innovation and growth, ultimately affecting economic productivity.

Beyond financial damage, cyberattacks have severe societal implications, eroding public trust in digital systems and institutions. When personal data is stolen, individuals face identity theft, financial fraud, and privacy breaches, leading to psychological distress and a loss of confidence in online services. Attacks on essential services, such as power grids or hospitals, can disrupt daily life, threaten public safety, and even cost lives. Moreover, nation-state cyber warfare and misinformation campaigns can destabilize governments, influence elections, and sow discord among populations. As digital dependency grows, cyberthreats pose an increasing risk to global stability, making robust cybersecurity measures essential for safeguarding both economic prosperity and societal wellbeing.

A few notable cyberattacks include:

**WannaCry ransomware attack.** In 2017, a massive ransomware attack that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows spread rapidly across more than 150 countries, affecting hospitals, businesses, and government agencies. Notable victims were the United Kingdom's National Health Service, FedEx, Renault, and Telefónica. The cyberattack caused damages of USD4 billion globally.

**Equifax data breach.** In 2017, cyberattackers exploited an unpatched software vulnerability, exposing the sensitive information of 147 million people. Data stolen included Social Security numbers, credit card details, and personal identifiers. Equifax paid a settlement of USD700 million for damages and credit monitoring services. This attack led to led to stricter data protection laws and heightened scrutiny of credit reporting agencies.

**SolarWinds supply chain attack.** In 2020, cyberattackers—targeting United States government agencies and Fortune 500 companies—compromised SolarWinds' Orion software, inserting a backdoor used to spy on networks. Victims included the United States Department of Homeland Security, Microsoft, and Intel.

**Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack.** In 2021, the Colonial Pipeline Company was attacked, resulting in the company shutting down all operations. To restore the computerized system used to manage oil pipelines throughout the southeastern United States, Colonial Pipeline paid the cyberattackers a ransom of 75 bitcoins (equivalent to USD4.4 million at the time). This cyberattack was the largest in United States history to target oil infrastructure, and it highlighted vulnerabilities in the energy and transportation sectors, prompting stronger cybersecurity measures.

**Cryptocurrency.** In March and April 2022, three different lending protocols came under cyberattack. In the span of one week, cyberattackers stole USD15.6 million worth of cryptocurrency from Inverse Finance, USD625 million from gaming-focused Ronin Network, and USD3.6 million from Ola Finance.

In recent years, cyberattacks have become more frequent, sophisticated, and financially damaging, with ransomware emerging as one of the most significant threats. Attackers increasingly target both individuals and organizations, encrypting critical data and demanding hefty ransom payments. High-profile ransomware attacks on hospitals, financial institutions, and infrastructure companies have disrupted operations and caused severe financial losses. Cybercriminals have also shifted to double extortion tactics, not only locking data but also threatening to leak sensitive information if the ransom isn't paid. The rise of ransomware as a service has further fueled this trend, enabling even non-technical cybercriminals to launch attacks with pre-built ransomware tools.

Another alarming trend is the growing sophistication of phishing schemes and state-sponsored cyberattacks. Modern phishing campaigns use AI-generated emails, deepfake technology, and social engineering tactics to trick even the most careful individuals into divulging sensitive information. These attacks often bypass traditional security measures, leading to credential theft and data breaches. Meanwhile, state-sponsored cyberattacks have become more prevalent, targeting critical infrastructure such as power grids, water treatment plants, and government agencies. These attacks, often attributed to nation-states seeking to disrupt rival economies or gather intelligence, highlight the need for stronger cybersecurity policies, enhanced threat detection systems, and international cooperation to defend against cyberwarfare.

## Key components

### Key components of AI for cybersecurity

AI is an overarching term that refers to computer systems that perform cognitive functions such as recognizing speech, making predictions, and analyzing complex data. Several branches of AI are used in cybersecurity.

**Machine learning** is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions. This capability is put to use in cybersecurity to uncover and automatically respond to potential threats across devices, users, and networks.

In **deep learning**, a more sophisticated branch of machine learning, AI systems process complex data structures using multilayer neural networks, which mimic the human brain's neural pathways. Deep learning and neural networks tend to be more effective than traditional machine learning at analyzing large sets of high-dimensional data and are used in cybersecurity to detect and respond to sophisticated threats.

Security professionals also use **generative AI** tools to assist in investigation and response. Because these tools use natural language processing technology, individuals can interact with them using human language, instead of code. As the name suggests, these tools are also capable of generating content, so they can help produce reports, summarize security insights and findings, and provide detailed responses to questions.

**AI-powered agents** autonomously manage high-volume security and IT tasks, empowering people to focus on proactive security. These agents can triage phishing, data loss prevention, and insider risk alerts, which are extremely time-consuming tasks for humans. Agents can also optimize conditional access policies based on user data. And many teams use AI-powered agents to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities and threats that need to be addressed.

## Use cases

### AI for cybersecurity use cases

AI has become a critical tool for helping security professionals do their jobs more effectively. Some common use cases are:

#### Identity and access management

AI is used for identity and access management (IAM) to understand patterns in user sign-in behaviors and surface anomalous behavior. It can also be used to automatically force two-factor authentication or a password reset when certain conditions are met. If there's reason to believe that an account has been compromised, AI-powered solutions can block a user from signing in.

#### Endpoint security and management

AI helps security professionals identify endpoints being used within the organization, so they can keep them updated with the latest operating systems and security solutions. It also helps uncover malware and other evidence of a cyberattack against an organization's devices.

#### Cloud security

Because organizations use multiple cloud providers for infrastructure and apps, they need solutions that provide protection across the entire estate. AI stitches together data from across various cloud services to provide a comprehensive view into an organization's cloud risks and vulnerabilities. This helps security professionals quickly address threats.

#### Data security

By reducing manual work, AI has helped accelerate many processes related to data security. Using AI, security teams are able to quickly identify and label sensitive data throughout the environment, whether it's housed on the organization's infrastructure or in a cloud app. AI can also rapidly detect when someone is trying to move data out of the company and either block the action or raise the issue to the security team.

#### Cyberthreat detection

Extended detection and response (XDR) and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions help security teams uncover cyberthreats across the entire enterprise. To do this, both solutions rely heavily on AI. XDR solutions use AI to monitor endpoints, emails, identities, and cloud apps for anomalous behavior, correlate incidents, and surface them to the team. Using advanced AI models, XDR solutions can also disrupt advanced attacks, like ransomware and provide suggestions to improve security coverage. SIEM solutions use AI to aggregate signals from across the enterprise, giving teams better visibility into what's happening. Teams also use AI to generate actionable insights from threat intelligence, which helps them take a more proactive approach to cyber risks.

#### Incident investigation and response

During incident response, security professionals must sort through mountains of data to uncover potential cyberattacks. AI helps identify and correlate the most useful events across multiple data sources, saving professionals valuable time. Generative AI simplifies investigation even further by answering questions and translating analysis into natural language.

## Protecting you vs protecting AI

### AI for cybersecurity vs AI security

It's important to distinguish between two related but different concepts: AI for cybersecurity and security for AI.

**AI for cybersecurity** refers to the use of AI tools to improve an organization's ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate threats to all its environment. Because AI for cybersecurity can analyze and correlate events across multiple sources, it helps organizations identify patterns that indicate potential threats.

**AI security**, on the other hand, focuses on the protection of AI systems themselves. It encompasses strategies, tools, and practices aimed at safeguarding AI models, data, and algorithms from threats. This includes ensuring that AI systems function as intended and that attackers cannot exploit vulnerabilities to manipulate outputs or steal sensitive information.

In summary, AI for cybersecurity refers to the use of AI systems to enhance an organization's overall security posture, while AI security is about protecting AI systems.

## Benefits

### Benefits of AI for cybersecurity

AI has really been a game changer in cybersecurity, making it easier for security professionals to respond to a growing number of cyberthreats, increasing amounts of data, and an expanding cyberattack surface. Here are some of the ways AI for cybersecurity helps teams be more effective:

**Faster threat detection**  
Many security solutions, such as SIEM or XDR, log thousands and thousands of events that indicate potentially anomalous behavior. Although the vast majority of these events are innocuous, some aren't, and the risk of missing a potential cyberthreat can be enormous. AI helps identify incidents that really matter. It also correlates seemingly unrelated activities into incidents that indicate a potential cyberthreat.

**Simplified reporting**  
Tools that use generative AI can correlate and analyze information from several data sources to create easy-to-understand reports that security professionals can quickly share with others in the organization.

**Vulnerability identification**  
AI helps detect weaknesses in the overall environment, such as unknown devices and cloud apps, outdated operating systems, or unprotected sensitive data.

**Skills enhancement**  
Because generative AI helps translate cyberthreat data and analysis into natural language, analysts don't need to know how to write queries to be productive. This helps junior analysts take on more complex tasks. Plus, generative AI provides remediation steps and other recommendations that help new team members quickly learn how to effectively respond to cyberattacks.

**Actionable insights**  
By aggregating and analyzing data from diverse sources like security logs, network traffic, and external threat feeds, AI provides a comprehensive view of the security landscape and reveals hidden patterns of attack.

**Reduction of false positives and false negatives.**  
AI helps reduce false positives and false negatives by using advanced techniques like pattern recognition, anomaly detection, contextual awareness, and continuous learning. These systems provide more nuanced decision-making and avoid overloading security teams with irrelevant alerts.

**Scalability**  
AI significantly enhances scalability in cybersecurity by automating tasks, processing large amounts of data in real time, and continuously learning. As the volume and complexity of cyberthreats grow, AI's ability to scale and adapt ensures that cybersecurity systems remain resilient, efficient, and capable of handling the demands of modern IT infrastructures.

## Tools

### AI-powered cybersecurity tools

AI has been integrated into several cybersecurity tools to help improve their effectiveness. A few examples are:

**Next-generation firewalls and AI.** Traditional firewalls make decisions about allowing or blocking traffic based on rules defined by an administrator. Next-generation firewalls go beyond these capabilities, using AI to tap into threat intelligence data to help identify novel cyberthreats.

**AI-enhanced endpoint security solutions.** Endpoint security solutions use AI to identify endpoint vulnerabilities, such as an outdated operating system. AI can also help detect whether malware has been installed on a device or if unusual amounts of data are being exfiltrated to or from an endpoint. During an ongoing attack, AI can automatically isolate the endpoint from the rest of the digital environment.

**AI-driven network intrusion detection and prevention systems.** These tools monitor network traffic to uncover unauthorized users who are trying to infiltrate the organization through the network. Using AI, these systems quickly process large volumes of data to identify and block cyberattackers before they cause damage.

**AI and cloud security solutions.** Because so many organizations use multiple clouds for their infrastructure and apps, it can be hard to track cyberthreats that move across different clouds and apps. AI helps with cloud security by analyzing data from all of these sources to identify vulnerabilities and potential cyberattacks.

**Internet of Things (IoT) security.** Much like endpoints and apps, organizations typically have many IoT devices that are potential cyberattack vectors. AI helps detect cyberthreats against any single IoT device and uncovers patterns of suspicious activity across multiple IoT devices.

**XDR and SIEM.** XDR and SIEM solutions pull information from multiple security products, log files, and external sources to help analysts make sense of what's happening in their environment. AI helps synthesize all of this data into clear insights.

## Best practices

### Best practices for AI for cybersecurity

Using AI to support security operations takes careful planning and implementation, but with the right approach, you can introduce tools that make meaningful improvements in operational effectiveness and your team's wellbeing.

It's important that your AI solutions integrate well with each other and your security architecture, or they may end up creating more work for your team. Consider your biggest security challenges first and then identify AI solutions that will help you solve those issues. Take time to develop a plan for integrating AI into your current processes and systems.

**Integrate your security tools**  
AI for cybersecurity is most effective when it's able to analyze data across the entire organization. This is challenging if your tools operate in silos. Invest in tools that work together and with your current environment seamlessly, such as integrated XDR and SIEM solutions. Or, if necessary, allocate time and resources for your team to integrate tools, so that you get complete visibility across your entire digital estate.

**Manage data privacy and quality**  
AI systems make decisions and provide insights based on the data used to train and operate them. If there are errors in the data or it's corrupted, AI will deliver poor insights and make bad decisions. During your planning, make sure you have processes in place to clean up data and protect privacy.

**Use AI ethically**  
A lot of the data that's accumulated over the years is inaccurate, biased, or outdated. On top of that, AI algorithms and logic aren't always transparent, making it difficult to know exactly how it generates insights and results. It's important to ensure that AI is not the final decision maker if there is a risk that it will treat certain individuals unfairly because of biased data. Learn more about responsible AI.

**Continuously test your AI systems**  
After implementation, test your systems regularly to identify bias or quality issues as new data is generated.

**Define policies for using generative AI**  
Ensure that employees and partners understand your organization's policies for using generative AI tools. It's especially important that people don't paste confidential and sensitive data into generative AI prompts because there's a risk that data might become public.

## Understanding cybersecurity

### What is cybersecurity?

As data has proliferated and more people work and connect from anywhere, bad actors have responded by developing a broad array of expertise and skills. Every year the number of cyberattacks increases as adversaries continue to evolve their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) and scale their operations.

This ever-evolving threat landscape necessitates that organizations create a dynamic, ongoing cybersecurity program to stay resilient and adapt to emerging risks. An effective cybersecurity program includes people, processes, and technology solutions to reduce the risk of business disruption, data theft, financial loss, and reputational damage from an attack.

## Types of cybersecurity threats

Bad actors continuously evolve their TTPs to evade detection and exploit vulnerabilities using a myriad of attack methods, including:

### Malware—like viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware

Malware is a catchall term for any malicious software, including worms, ransomware, spyware, and viruses. It is designed to cause harm to computers or networks by altering or deleting files, extracting sensitive data like passwords and account numbers, or sending malicious emails or traffic. Malware may be installed by an attacker who gains access to the network, but often, individuals unwittingly deploy malware on their devices or company network after clicking on a bad link or downloading an infected attachment.

Malware is often used to establish a foothold in a network, creating a backdoor that lets cyberattackers move laterally within the system. It can also be used to steal data or encrypt files in ransomware attacks.

### Phishing and social engineering attacks

In social engineering, attackers take advantage of people's trust to dupe them into handing over account information or downloading malware. In these attacks, bad actors masquerade as a known brand, coworker, or friend and use psychological techniques such as creating a sense of urgency to get people to do what they want.

Phishing is a type of social engineering that uses emails, text messages, or voicemails that appear to be from a reputable source and ask users to click on a link that requires them to login—allowing the attacker to steal their credentials. Some phishing campaigns are sent to a huge number of people in the hope that one person will click. Other campaigns, called spear phishing, are more targeted and focus on a single person. For example, an adversary might pretend to be a job seeker to trick a recruiter into downloading an infected resume. More recently, AI has been used in phishing scams to make them more personalized, effective, and efficient, which makes them harder to detect.

### Ransomware

Ransomware, also known as cyber extortion, is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's data and demands payment (often in cryptocurrency) to restore access. Cyber extortion can have devastating financial and reputational consequences for businesses and individuals.

There are two main types of ransomware attacks: commodity-based ransomware and human-operated ransomware. Commodity-based attacks are typically automated and indiscriminate, targeting a wide range of victims using mass-distributed malware. In contrast, human-operated ransomware is a more targeted approach where attackers manually infiltrate and navigate networks, often spending weeks in systems to maximize the impact and potential payout of the attack.

### Identity threats

Identity threats involve malicious efforts to steal or misuse personal or organizational identities that allow the attacker to access sensitive information or move laterally within the network. Brute force attacks are attempts to guess passwords by trying many combinations. Credential theft occurs when attackers steal login details, often through phishing, allowing them to login as an authorized user and access accounts and sensitive inform.

### Business email compromise

Business email compromise is a type of is a type of phishing attack where an attacker compromises the email of a legitimate business or trusted partner and sends phishing emails posing as a senior executive attempting to trick employees into transferring money or sensitive data to them.

### Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks

A DoS attack seeks to overwhelm a system or network, making it unavailable to users. DDoS attacks use multiple devices to flood a target with traffic, causing service interruptions or complete shutdowns.

### Advance persistent threats (APTs)

APTs involve attackers gaining unauthorized access to a network and remaining undetected for extended periods. ATPs are also known as multistage attacks, and are often carried out by nation-state actors or established threat actor groups. Their goal is to steal data or sabotage the system over time, often targeting governments or large corporations. ATPs employ multiple other types of attacks—including phishing, malware, identity attacks—to gain access. Human-operated ransomware is a common type of APT.

### Insider threats

Insider threats come from individuals within an organization who either accidentally or maliciously compromise security. These threats may arise from disgruntled employees or those with access to sensitive information. This can include an employee downloading data to share with a competitor or accidentally sending sensitive data without encryption over a compromised channel.

## Threat actors

### Who are we defending against?

Understanding the motivations and profiles of attackers is essential in developing effective cybersecurity defenses. Some of the key adversaries in today's threat landscape include:

### Nation-state sponsored actors

A nation-state sponsored actor is a group or individual that is supported by a government to conduct cyberattacks against other countries, organizations, or individuals. State-sponsored cyberattackers often have vast resources and sophisticated tools at their disposal. Their motivations can range from espionage to destabilizing infrastructure, with attacks often targeting governments, critical infrastructure, and corporations. Nation-state sponsored actors are typically the most well-resourced and effective type of attacker. They sometimes sell their tooling to smaller groups.

### Ransomware groups

These organized criminal groups deploy ransomware to extort businesses for financial gain. They are typically leading sophisticated, multistage hands-on-keyboard attacks that steal data and disrupt business operations, demanding hefty ransom payments in exchange for decryption keys.

### Cyber mercenaries/private sector offensive actors

Cyber mercenaries are hackers for hire who offer their services to governments, corporations, or criminal organizations. They conduct espionage, sabotage, or other malicious activities on behalf of their clients.

## Frameworks and standards

### Cybersecurity frameworks and standards

Organizations rely on well-established frameworks and standards to guide their cybersecurity efforts. Some of the most widely adopted frameworks include:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), this framework provides guidelines for managing and reducing cybersecurity risk.
- **ISO/IEC 27001:** A global standard for managing information security that outlines a systematic approach to securing sensitive data.
- **CIS Controls:** The Center for Internet Security's critical security controls offer a set of best practices for defending against cyber threats.

### Importance of compliance and regulatory requirements

Regulatory bodies mandate certain security measures for organizations handling sensitive data. Non-compliance can result in legal consequences and fines. Adhering to well-established frameworks helps ensure organizations protect customer data and avoid regulatory penalties.

### Choosing the right framework for your organization

Selecting the right cybersecurity framework depends on an organization's size, industry, and regulatory environment. Organizations should consider their risk tolerance, compliance requirements, and security needs and choose a framework that aligns with their goals.

## Tools and technologies

### Cybersecurity tools and technologies

To defend against modern cyber threats, organizations need a multi-layered defense strategy that employs various tools and technologies, including:

### Endpoint Protection and antivirus software

Endpoint protection software secures individual devices (laptops, smartphones, etc.) against malware, ransomware, and other threats. Antivirus software scans for and removes malicious software from devices.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM) Solutions

IAM solutions help organizations control who has access to critical information and systems, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access sensitive resources.

### Firewalls and Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)

Firewalls act as the first line of defense, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. IDPS systems detect and prevent intrusions by analyzing network traffic for signs of malicious activity.

### Cloud security

Cloud security encompasses the technologies, procedures, policies, and controls that help you protect your cloud-based systems and data.

### Collaboration security

Collaboration security is a framework of tools and practices designed to protect the exchange of information and workflows within digital workspaces like messaging apps, shared documents, and video conferencing platforms. It aims to safeguard against unauthorized access, data leaks, and cyber threats while enabling seamless collaboration among team members. Effective collaboration security ensures that employees can work together securely from anywhere, maintaining compliance and protecting sensitive information.

### Encryption and data protection tools

Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Strong encryption is essential for protecting sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems

SIEM systems collect and analyze security data from across an organization's IT infrastructure, providing real-time insights into potential threats and helping with incident response.

### Extended detection and response (XDR)

Extended detection and response, often abbreviated as XDR, is a unified security incident platform that uses AI and automation. It provides organizations with a holistic, efficient way to protect against and respond to advanced cyberattacks.

### Unified SecOps Platforms

A Unified SecOps platforms provides all the tools a security operations center needs to protect their organization. At minimum, a security operations platform should include an Extended Detection and Response (XDR), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration and Automated Response (SOAR), and some type of posture solution. While new, GenAI is also becoming an increasingly important component to the platform.

## Best practices

### Strategies and policies for cybersecurity

Effective cybersecurity isn't just about technology; it requires a comprehensive approach that includes the following best practices:

### Implement a Zero Trust policy

A Zero Trust approach assumes that no one—inside or outside the network—should be trusted by default. This means continuously verifying the identity of users and devices before granting access to sensitive data.

### Ensuring entire organization is aligned to Zero Trust policy

It's essential for all employees, from leadership to entry-level, to understand and follow the organization's Zero Trust policy. This alignment reduces the risk of accidental breaches or malicious insider activity.

### Implementing a Robust Security Policy

A well-defined security policy provides clear guidelines on how to protect information assets. This includes acceptable use policies, incident response plans, and protocols for managing sensitive data.

### Security hygiene, patch management, and software updates

Regularly updating software and systems is critical for patching vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Security hygiene, such as strong password practices and regularly backing up data, further strengthens defenses.

### Regular security training and cybersecurity awareness programs

Employees are often the first line of defense against cyberattacks. Regular training helps them recognize phishing attempts, social engineering tactics, and other potential threats.

### Conduct regular security audits and assessments

Periodic security audits help identify weaknesses in an organization's defenses. Conducting regular assessments ensures that the security infrastructure remains up-to-date and effective against evolving threats.

### Incident response planning and management

An incident response plan prepares an organization to quickly and effectively respond to a cyberattack. This minimizes damage, ensures continuity of operations, and helps restore normalcy as quickly as possible.

## Case studies

### Case studies and real-world examples

There's no doubt that cybercrime is on the rise. Recent Microsoft Entra data shows that attempted password attacks have increased to 4,000 per second on average. In 2023, human-operated ransomware attacks increased 195%.

Preventing these and other security attacks often comes down to effective security hygiene. Regular software updates, patching, and password management are essential for reducing vulnerability. Basic practices like ensuring secure configurations and using up-to-date antivirus software significantly lower the risk of successful attacks.

Implementing extended detection and response (XDR) significantly reduces risk. Security strategies like least privilege access and multi-factor authentication can mitigate many attack vectors.

## Emerging trends

### The future of cybersecurity

The cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve with new threats and opportunities emerging, including:

### AI and machine learning

AI, machine learning, and generative AI are transforming cybersecurity with real-time threat detection, automated incident response, and the ability to predict how potential vulnerabilities could be exploited in an attack. Generative AI enhances these capabilities by simulating attack scenarios, analyzing vast data sets to uncover patterns, and helping security teams stay one step ahead in a constantly evolving threat landscape.

### Cloud security challenges and solutions

As more businesses migrate to the cloud, they face challenges in securing distributed environments. Solutions like multi-factor authentication, encryption, and access controls are essential for protecting cloud-based assets.

### Supply chain security

Supply chain attacks, such as those targeting third-party vendors, are becoming more common. Organizations must vet their suppliers and implement security measures to protect their supply chains from compromise.

### What comes next

There's no doubt that cybercrime is on the rise. In the second half of 2024, Microsoft mitigated 1.25 million DDoS attacks, representing a 4x increase compared with last year. In the next decade, we can expect continued growth in cybercrime, with attacks becoming more sophisticated and targeted.

Staying ahead of threats requires constant vigilance and adaptation. Implementing extended detection and response (extended detection and response (XDR) significantly reduces risk. Organizations should continuously invest in security training, tools, and AI for cybersecurity to stay resilient against ever-evolving threats.

## How cyber threat hunting works

Cyber threat hunting utilizes threat hunters to preemptively search for potential threats and attacks within a system or network. Doing so allows for agile, efficient responses to increasingly complex, human-operated cyberattacks. While traditional cybersecurity methods identify security breaches after the fact, cyber threat hunting operates under the assumption that a breach has occurred, and can identify, adapt, and respond to potential threats immediately upon detection.

Sophisticated attackers can breach an organization and remain undetected for extended periods of time—days, weeks, or even longer. Adding cyber threat hunting to your existing profile of security tools, like endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security information and event management (SIEM), can help you prevent and remediate attacks that might otherwise go undetected by automated security tools.

### Automated threat hunting

Cyber threat hunters can automate certain aspects of the process by using machine learning, automation, and AI. Taking advantage of solutions like SIEM and EDR can help threat hunters streamline hunting procedures by monitoring, detecting, and responding to potential threats. Threat hunters can create and automate different playbooks to respond to different threats, thereby easing the burden on IT teams whenever similar attacks arise.

### Tools and techniques for cyber threat hunting

Threat hunters have numerous tools at their disposal, including solutions like SIEM and XDR, which are designed to work together.

- **SIEM:** A solution that collects data from multiple sources with real-time analysis, SIEM can provide threat hunters with clues about potential threats.
- **Extended detection and response (XDR):** Threat hunters can use XDR, which provides threat intelligence and automated attack disruption, to achieve greater visibility into threats.
- **EDR:** EDR, which monitors end-user devices also provides threat hunters with a powerful tool, giving them insight into potential threats within all of an organization's endpoints.

## Three types of cyber threat hunting

Cyber threat hunting typically takes one of the following three forms:

### Structured

In a structured hunt, threat hunters look for suspicious tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that suggest potential threats. Rather than approaching the data or system and looking for breachers, the threat hunter creates a hypothesis about a potential attacker's method and methodically works to identify symptoms of that attack. Because structured hunting is a more proactive approach, IT professionals who employ this tactic can often intercept or stop attackers quickly.

### Unstructured

In an unstructured hunt, the cyber threat hunter searches for an indicator of compromise (IoC) and conducts the search from this starting point. Because the threat hunter can go back and search historical data for patterns and clues, unstructured hunts can sometimes identify previously undetected threats that may still place the organization at risk.

### Situational

Situational threat hunting prioritizes specific resources or data within the digital ecosystem. If an organization assesses that particular employees or assets are the highest risks, it can direct cyber threat hunters to concentrate efforts or preventing or remediating attacks against these vulnerable people, datasets, or endpoints.

## Threat hunting steps and implementation

Cyber threat hunters often follow these basic steps when investigating and remediating threats and attacks:

1. **Create a theory or hypothesis about a potential threat.** Threat hunters might start by identifying an attacker's common TTPs.

2. **Conduct research.** Threat hunters investigate the organization's data, systems, and activities— a SIEM solution can be a useful tool—and collect and process relevant information.

3. **Identify the trigger.** Research findings and other security tools can help threat hunters distinguish a starting point for their investigation.

4. **Investigate the threat.** Threat hunters use their research and security tools to determine if the threat is malicious.

5. **Respond and remediate.** Threat hunters take action to resolve the threat.

## Types of threats hunters can detect

Cyber threat hunting has the capacity to identify a wide range of different threats, including the following:

### Malware and viruses

Malware impedes the use of normal devices by gaining unauthorized access to endpoint devices. Phishing attacks, spyware, adware, trojans, worms, and ransomware are all examples of malware. Viruses, some of the more common forms of malware, are designed to interfere with a device's normal operation by recording, corrupting, or deleting its data before spreading to other devices on a network.

### Insider threats

Insider threats stem from individuals with authorized access to an organization's network. Whether through malicious actions or inadvertent or negligent behaviors, these insiders misuse or cause harm to the organization's networks, data, systems, or facilities.

### Advanced persistent threats

Sophisticated actors who breach an organization's network and remain undetected for a period of time represent advanced persistent threats. These attackers are skilled and often well-resourced.

### Social engineering attacks

Cyberattackers can use manipulation and deception to mislead an organization's employees into giving away access or sensitive information. Common social engineering attacks include phishing, baiting, and scareware.

## Cyber threat hunting best practices

When implementing a cyber threat hunting protocol at your organization, keep the following best practices in mind:

- **Give threat hunters full visibility into your organization.** Threat hunters are most successful when they understand the big picture.

- **Maintain complementary security tools like SIEM, XDR, and EDR.** Cyber threat hunters rely on automations and data provided by these tools to identify threats more quickly and with greater context for faster resolution.

- **Stay informed on the latest emerging threats and tactics.** Attackers and their tactics are constantly evolving—make sure your threat hunters have the most up-to-date resources on current trends.

- **Train employees to identify and report suspicious behaviors.** Reduce the possibility of insider threats by keeping your people informed.

- **Implement vulnerability management to reduce your organization's overall risk exposure.**

## Why threat hunting is important for organizations

As malicious actors become increasingly sophisticated in their methods of attack, it is vital for organizations to invest in proactive cyber threat hunting. Complementary to more passive forms of threat protection, cyber threat hunting closes security gaps, allowing organizations to remediate threats that would otherwise go undetected. Intensifying threats from complex attackers mean that organizations must bolster their defenses to maintain trust in their ability to handle sensitive data and reduce costs associated with security breaches.

Products like Microsoft Sentinel can help you stay ahead of threats by collecting, storing, and accessing historical data at cloud scale, streamlining investigations, and automating common tasks. These solutions can provide cyber threat hunters with powerful tools to help keep your organization protected.

## Indicators of compromise explained

An indicator of compromise (IOC) is evidence that someone may have breached an organization's network or endpoint. This forensic data doesn't just indicate a potential threat, it signals that an attack, such as malware, compromised credentials, or data exfiltration, has already occurred. Security professionals search for IOCs on event logs, extended detection and response (XDR) solutions, and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions. During an attack, the team uses IOCs to eliminate the threat and mitigate damage. After recovery, IOCs help an organization better understand what happened, so the organization's security team can strengthen security and reduce the risk of another similar incident.

## Examples of IOCs

In IOC security, IT monitors the environment for the following clues that an attack is in progress:

### Network traffic anomalies

In most organizations there are consistent patterns to network traffic passing in and out of the digital environment. When that changes, such as if there is significantly more data leaving the organization or if there is activity coming from an unusual location in the network, it may be a sign of an attack.

### Unusual sign-in attempts

Much like network traffic, people's work habits are predictable. They typically sign in from the same locations and at roughly the same times during the week. Security professionals can detect a compromised account by paying attention to sign-ins at odd times of day or from unusual geographies, such as a country where an organization doesn't have an office. It's also important to take note of multiple failed sign-ins from the same account. Although people periodically forget their passwords or have trouble signing in, they're usually able to resolve it after a few tries. Repeated failed sign-in attempts may indicate that someone is trying to access the organization using a stolen account.

### Privilege account irregularities

Many attackers, whether they're insiders or outsiders, are interested in accessing administrative accounts and acquiring sensitive data. Atypical behavior associated with these accounts, such as someone attempting to escalate their privileges, may be a sign of a breach.

### Changes to systems configurations

Malware is often programmed to make changes to systems configurations, such as enabling remote access or disabling security software. By monitoring for these unexpected configuration changes, security professionals can identify a breach before too much damage has occurred.

### Unexpected software installations or updates

Many attacks begin with the installation of software, such as malware or ransomware, that is designed to make files inaccessible or to give attackers access to the network. By monitoring for unplanned software installations and updates, organizations can catch these IOCs quickly.

### Numerous requests for the same file

Multiple requests for a single file may indicate that a bad actor is attempting to steal it and has tried several methods to access it.

### Unusual Domain Name Systems requests

Some bad actors use an attack method called command and control. They install malware on an organization's server that creates a connection to a server that they own. They then send commands from their server to the infected machine to try to steal data or disrupt operations. Unusual Domain Name Systems (DNS) requests helps IT detect these attacks.

## How to identify IOCs

The signs of a digital attack are recorded in the log files. As part of IOC cybersecurity, teams regularly monitor digital systems for suspicious activity. Modern SIEM and XDR solutions simplify this process with AI and machine learning algorithms that establish a baseline for what's normal in the organization and then alert the team about anomalies. It's also important to engage employees outside of security, who may receive suspicious emails or accidentally download an infected file. Good security training programs help workers get better at detecting compromised emails and provide ways for them to report anything that seems off.

## Why IOCs are important

Monitoring IOCs is critical to reducing an organization's security risk. Early detection of IOCs enables security teams to respond to and resolve attacks quickly, reducing the amount of downtime and disruption. Regular monitoring also gives teams greater insight into organizational vulnerabilities, which can then be mitigated.

## Responding to indicators of compromise

Once security teams identify an IOC, they need to respond effectively to ensure as little damage to the organization as possible. The following steps help organizations stay focused and stop threats as quickly as possible:

### Establish an incident response plan

Responding to an incident is stressful and time sensitive because the longer attackers remain undetected, the more likely they are to achieve their goals. Many organizations develop an incident response plan to help guide teams during the critical phases of a response. The plan outlines how the organization defines an incident, roles and responsibilities, the steps needed to resolve an incident, and how the team should communicate to employees and outside stakeholders.

### Isolate compromised systems and devices

Once an organization has identified a threat, the security team rapidly isolates applications or systems that are under attack from the rest of the networks. This helps prevent the attackers from accessing other parts of the business.

### Conduct forensic analysis

Forensic analysis helps organizations uncover all aspects of a breach, including the source, the type of attack, and attacker goals. Analysis is done during the attack to understand the extent of the compromise. Once the organization has recovered from the attack, additional analysis helps the team understand possible vulnerabilities and other insights.

### Eliminate the threat

The team removes the attacker and any malware from affected systems and resources, which may involve taking systems offline.

### Implement security and process improvements

Once the organization has recovered from the incident, it's important to evaluate why the attack happened and if there's anything the organization could have done to prevent it. There may be simple process and policy improvements that will reduce the risk of a similar attack in the future, or the team may identify longer-range solutions to add to a security roadmap.

## IOC Solutions

Most security breaches leave a forensic trail in log files and systems. Learning to identify and monitor these IOCs helps organizations quickly isolate and eliminate attackers. Many teams turn to SIEM solutions, like Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR, which use AI and automation to surface IOCs and correlate them with other events. An incident response plan enables teams to get ahead of attacks and quickly shut them down. When it comes to cybersecurity, the faster companies understand what's happening, the more likely they are to stop an attack before it costs them money or damages their reputation. IOC security is key to helping organizations reduce their risk of a costly breach.

## Frequently asked questions

**What are the types of IOCs?**

There are several types of IOCs. Some of the most common are:
- Network traffic anomalies
- Unusual sign-in attempts
- Privilege account irregularities
- Changes to system configurations
- Unexpected software installations or updates
- Numerous requests for the same file
- Unusual Domain Name Systems requests

**What is the difference between indicators of attack and indicators of compromise?**

An indicator of compromise is digital evidence that an attack has already occurred. An indicator of an attack is evidence that an attack is likely to occur. For example, a phishing campaign is an indicator of attack because there's no evidence that the attacker has breached the company. However, if someone clicks on a phishing link and downloads malware, the installation of the malware is an indicator of compromise.

**What are indicators of compromise in email?**

Indicators of compromise in email include a sudden flood of spam, strange attachments or links, or an unexpected email from a known person. For example, if an employee sends a coworker an email with a strange attachment, it may indicate their account has been compromised.

**How would you identify a compromised system?**

There are multiple ways to identify a compromised system. A change in network traffic from a particular computer could be an indicator that it's been compromised. If a person who typically doesn't need a system begins accessing it regularly, that's a red flag. Changes to the configurations on the system or an unexpected software installation may also indicate that it's been compromised.

**What are three IOC examples?**

Three IOC examples are:
1. A user account that is based in North America begins signing into company resources from Europe.
2. Thousands of access requests across several user accounts, indicating that the organization is a victim of a brute force attack.
3. New Domain Name Systems requests coming from a new host or a country where employees and customers don't reside.
