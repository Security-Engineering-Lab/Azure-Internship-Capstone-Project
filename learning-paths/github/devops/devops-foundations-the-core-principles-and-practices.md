# 1 Discover DevOps

Optimize application lifecycle management through DevOps practices such as collaboration, continuous learning, agility, and automation. Your organization benefits from accelerated time to market, stability and reliability in operations, and minimize mean time to recovery



# 1.1 Introduction

DevOps is a concept that aims to address the challenges associated with traditional application lifecycle.

> "DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users." - Donovan Brown

Imagine that you work for a software development company in the retail industry. Your company is planning to migrate from an old app to a new app. However, the development team and the operations team have conflicting objectives. The development team wants to release new features quickly to attract more customers, while the operations team wants to ensure stability and reliability of the application. This conflict leads to delays in releasing new features and frequent downtime for the application. Your company realizes that it needs to adopt DevOps practices to overcome these challenges and deliver high-quality software efficiently and reliably.

In this module, learn about the key elements of DevOps culture and how they promote collaboration, transparency, shared responsibility, and continuous learning. The module covers topics such as collaboration, transparency, alignment, shared responsibility, accountability, empowerment, continuous learning, measurable outcomes, customer-centric focus, agility, automation, and security integration. Also, explore the value that DevOps brings to organizations, including accelerated time to market, adaptability to market dynamics, stability and reliability in operations, and minimizing mean time to recovery (MTTR). Additionally, understand how DevOps practices optimize application lifecycle management, impacting every phase from planning to operations.

By the end of this module, have a clear understanding of the principles, practices, and values of DevOps and how they can be applied to optimize software delivery and improve collaboration between development and operations teams.

# 1.2 What is DevOps?

DevOps is a commonly misunderstood and mischaracterized term. Before you explore more nuanced aspects of DevOps, it's essential that you understand its meaning and what DevOps isn't.

## What is DevOps (and what isn't)?

DevOps is a set of principles, practices, and values that are meant to enhance cross-team synergies, with the common goal of optimizing software delivery.

It's not a state that an organization can reach, but rather a continuous journey that requires an ongoing commitment and effort from all stakeholders.

It's also important to note that DevOps isn't tied to a specific technology or tools.

Now to explore DevOps in a contextual way, let's consider the traditional organization in the software development company example in which the development team and the operations team work in silos. Review challenges associated with this scenario and examine the meaning of DevOps in this context and how it can help.

## What challenges are associated with a traditional application lifecycle?

Traditional application lifecycle tends to separate developing software from the process of operationalizing it, which involves delivering it to its intended recipients and ensuring that it functions in the optimal manner. This siloed approach leads to many inefficiencies.

For one, developers and operational teams have commonly different objectives. The former focuses on innovation and continuous enhancements to their software. The primary objective of the latter is maintaining the stability and security of the environment they support.

The conflicting goals result in clashes, driving a wedge between different parts of the internal IT organization.

In addition, traditional operational practices are frequently based on an outdated, largely manual approach, which is inherently slow and vulnerable to human errors. This impedes the pace of innovation and increases the level of risk associated with deployment of new or updated versions of applications.

## How does DevOps help?

The purpose of DevOps is to address these inefficiencies. This is accomplished by uniting people, processes, and technologies. DevOps promotes coordination and collaboration between traditionally siloed roles, spanning such areas as development, operations, quality engineering, and security.
