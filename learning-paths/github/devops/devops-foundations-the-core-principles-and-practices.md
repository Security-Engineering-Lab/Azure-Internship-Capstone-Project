# 1.2 What is DevOps?


https://youtu.be/kBV8gPVZNEE

DevOps is a commonly misunderstood and mischaracterized term. Before you explore more nuanced aspects of DevOps, it's essential that you understand its meaning and what DevOps isn't.

## What is DevOps (and what isn't)?

DevOps is a set of principles, practices, and values that are meant to enhance cross-team synergies, with the common goal of optimizing software delivery.

It's not a state that an organization can reach, but rather a continuous journey that requires an ongoing commitment and effort from all stakeholders.

It's also important to note that DevOps isn't tied to a specific technology or tools.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/discover-devops/media/2-devops-toolchain.png)

Now to explore DevOps in a contextual way, let's consider the traditional organization in the software development company example in which the development team and the operations team work in silos. Review challenges associated with this scenario and examine the meaning of DevOps in this context and how it can help.

## What challenges are associated with a traditional application lifecycle?

Traditional application lifecycle tends to separate developing software from the process of operationalizing it, which involves delivering it to its intended recipients and ensuring that it functions in the optimal manner. This siloed approach leads to many inefficiencies.

For one, developers and operational teams have commonly different objectives. The former focuses on innovation and continuous enhancements to their software. The primary objective of the latter is maintaining the stability and security of the environment they support.

The conflicting goals result in clashes, driving a wedge between different parts of the internal IT organization.

In addition, traditional operational practices are frequently based on an outdated, largely manual approach, which is inherently slow and vulnerable to human errors. This impedes the pace of innovation and increases the level of risk associated with deployment of new or updated versions of applications.

## How does DevOps help?

The purpose of DevOps is to address these inefficiencies. This is accomplished by uniting people, processes, and technologies. DevOps promotes coordination and collaboration between traditionally siloed roles, spanning such areas as development, operations, quality engineering, and security.


# 1.3 Explore DevOps culture

DevOps extends beyond technology, tools, and processes, forming an organizational culture. In the software-development company example, it becomes crucial to start by focusing on less tangible components of organizational life, such as team collaboration, shared responsibility, empowerment, continuous learning, and agile mindset. Here, use this context to examine DevOps culture and its key elements.

## What is DevOps culture?

DevOps culture encompasses the human and organizational factors that impact software development and delivery. As such, DevOps represents a culture that promotes collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility among all organizational stakeholders. The DevOps culture creates a collaborative, transparent, and continuously improving environment where teams work together to deliver high-quality software in an efficient and reliable manner. It involves a shift in mindset and behaviors, fostering a culture of trust, communication, and shared responsibility.

## What are the key elements of DevOps culture?

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/discover-devops/media/3-devops-culture.png)

The key elements of DevOps culture can be summarized as follows:

* **Collaboration:** DevOps encourages teamwork and open communication across teams, eliminating silos and improving efficiency.

* **Transparency:** Openness and visibility into development and operations processes enhance understanding and decision-making.

* **Shared responsibility:** DevOps emphasizes collective efforts and continuous improvements, replacing blame with collaboration.

* **Continuous learning:** The DevOps culture promotes regular process reviews, identifying areas for improvement and enhancing efficiency.

* **Measurable outcomes:** DevOps relies on the use of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to validate successful deliveries as well as to identify the need for innovations and enhancements. Measurable outcomes serve as an essential component of data-driven decision making and continuous learning.

* **Customer-centric focus:** DevOps values the customer's experience and emphasizes accelerated and reliable software delivery.

* **Agility:** DevOps organizations are adaptable and responsive to change, embracing an agile mindset.

* **Automation:** Automation increases efficiency, reduces errors, and accelerates development and deployment processes in DevOps.

* **Security Integration:** Security is an essential part of DevOps, permeating throughout each stage, which hints for the reason behind coining the term DevSecOps. DevSecOps is an extension of DevOps, with the focus on integrating security practices into the DevOps processes.



# 1.4 Explore DevOps goals and benefits

It should become fairly clear at this point that DevOps could bring significant value to practically any organization that relies on technology to deliver products and services to its customers. This certainly applies to the sample scenario we introduced in this module, where legacy operations negatively affected the pace of innovation and the risk associated with software deployment and maintenance. To appreciate the positive impact of DevOps, let's examine its benefits and goals in more detail.

## What are the primary goals and benefits of DevOps?

Embracing the DevOps culture can bring about a wide range of advantages for organizations, including:

* **Accelerating time to market**: Implementing DevOps practices facilitates the rapid release of software and its updates, reducing the time it takes to deliver them to their consumers. This acceleration enhances an organization's responsiveness to evolving customer needs and industry trends.

* **Adapting to market dynamics and competition**: DevOps fosters an agile and responsive development process, enabling organizations to quickly adapt to changes in the market and respond to competitive pressures. This adaptability ensures that businesses are able to adjust to evolving customer expectations.

* **Sustaining stability and reliability in operations**: DevOps principles emphasize collaboration between development and operations teams, leading to more stable and reliable operational environments. This collaboration helps identify and address issues early in the development cycle, minimizing disruptions and enhancing the overall stability of the operational environment.

* **Minimizing the mean time to recovery (MTTR)**: DevOps practices focus on automation, continuous monitoring, and rapid feedback loops, leading to quicker detection and resolution of issues. This, in turn, significantly improves the MTTR, ensuring that the impact of any disruption is minimized and that operations are quickly restored to their optimal state.

## Are DevOps benefits limited to traditional applications?

It's important to note that DevOps benefits extend beyond the lifecycle of traditional applications. Its scope includes, for example, such areas as machine learning (with operations applied to implementing machine learning models) and infrastructure (with Infrastructure as Code applied to deployment of underlying platform services).

*Machine Learning Operations*, often referred to as simply *MLOps*, focus on transitioning from the development of machine learning models to their provisioning in production environments. By following MLOps practices, organizations can ensure that their workloads are resilient and can be easily recreated. This includes monitoring, retraining, and redeploying models on an as-needed basis, and maintaining their stability following each deployment.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/discover-devops/media/4-machine-learning-operations.png)

*Infrastructure as Code*, commonly abbreviated as *IaC*, involves managing and provisioning compute, networking, and storage infrastructure via programming methods, rather than by relying on configuring physical hardware or using interactive administrative tools. IaC allows developers and operations teams to define and manage infrastructure elements such as servers, network devices, and databases using code. This code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable scripting language. The scripts are then executed to automate the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure, making it more efficient, consistent, and easily scalable.

# 1.5 Explore DevOps application lifecycle

While DevOps practices have a vast scope, their primary target is optimizing application lifecycle management. In the fictitious company example, migration from an existing app to a new app with updated features requires revisiting every phase of the application lifecycle. As such, learn how DevOps principles can significantly alter how each phase is implemented, from planning, through development and delivery, to operations. In this unit, step through a high-level overview of these implementations.

## Application Lifecycle phases

Application lifecycle phases include planning, development, delivery, and operations.

*Screenshot of the DevOps and Application Lifecycle.*

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/discover-devops/media/5-devops-lifecycle.png)

### Planning

The planning phase involves reviewing customer needs in order to outline and define features and capabilities of the software to be developed. Such software can range from individual microservices to portfolios consisting of multiple products. The outcome defines software requirements, scope, and milestones for the application's development and deployment. From the DevOps perspective, the primary considerations during this phase include agility, customer-centric focus, alignment, and visibility.

### Development

The development phase covers all aspects of developing application code. These aspects include programming, testing, and code reviews. To comply with DevOps practices, the code should reside in a source control system, which facilitates collaboration and supports versioning. A working version of the code is used to build artifacts suitable for subsequent delivery. Such artifacts can take the form of executable binaries, software libraries, container images, installer packages, configuration files, deployment scripts, or even documentation.

Changes at this phase should be applied in small increments through automated testing and build, referred to as continuous integration (CI), which accelerates the development process and enhances agility.

### Delivery

Delivery is the process of deploying the artifacts built during the development stage into production environments in a consistent and reliable manner. While the ultimate goal at this phase is full automation through continuous delivery (CD), some organizations, especially in early stages of their DevOps adoption, might choose to implement manual approvals or checks. As the confidence in DevOps practices grows, it's typically possible to fully automate these checks. For example, a successful, unattended verification of a deployment to a staging environment might serve as the basis for transitioning to the production environment. Automation helps make delivery processes scalable, repeatable, and, more resilient (by minimizing the possibility of human error). The key to a successful implementation of such an approach is following DevOps practices, including proper testing, the use of observable measurements, and continuous learning.

Delivery should also take into account provisioning and configuring the target environment's infrastructure through IaC. Treating infrastructure as code offers a range of benefits, including consistency, reproducibility, and agility.

### Operations

The operations phase involves maintaining, monitoring, and troubleshooting applications in production environments. From the DevOps perspective, the primary objectives at this stage are stability and reliability, rapid incident response, security and compliance, and customer satisfaction. To some extent, reaching these objectives is dependent on having properly implemented measurable outcomes. DevOps processes also rely on so called feedback loops that deliver data reflecting the current state of the deployed application such as performance metrics, responsiveness, and overall user experience, including improved or degraded functionality.

During this phase, it's important to ensure the maximum levels of collaboration between development, operations, and security teams. This phase also serves as the essential source of continuous learning.

## What's the final stage of the application lifecycle?

As the name indicates and the image at the beginning of this unit illustrates, the application lifecycle is, by design, a circular process. There's a deterministic beginning and end of an application lifespan determined by its inception and decommissioning events. However, following the initial deployment (or frequently, even earlier), feedback from users and monitoring data inform subsequent updates and the evolution of the application.

> **Note**
>
> Keep in mind that even though security was mentioned only a few times throughout this unit, according to DevSecOps principles, its role pervades throughout application lifecycle. Effectively, security-related considerations should be accounted for during each phase, starting at the very beginning of the initial planning.

In this module, learn how to foster a DevOps culture in an organization by promoting collaboration, transparency, shared responsibility, and continuous learning. You'll learn about the importance of an Agile approach to software development and project management as part of DevOps, the characteristics of different agile frameworks, fundamental DevOps practices such as version control, continuous integration, continuous testing, continuous delivery, continuous monitoring, continuous security, and Infrastructure as Code, and how GitHub Projects can facilitate the planning of your projects.

By the end of this module, you'll have a clear understanding of the principles, practices, and values of DevOps and how they can be applied to optimize application lifecycle management in every phase from planning to operations.


# 2.2 Foster DevOps culture


In order to fully realize DevOps benefits, organizations need to make a conscious effort of fostering the DevOps culture among their teams. This involves promoting collaboration, automation, and a mindset of continuous improvement, which ultimately will lead to faster, more reliable, and customer-centric software delivery. Such effort would be essential in our sample scenario, where the organization just started exploring the option to adopt DevOps practices. However, changing a corporate culture is a challenging undertaking. In this unit, you'll review a set of recommendations that should facilitate addressing this challenge.

## How should organizations foster DevOps culture?

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/plan-with-devops/media/2-foster-devops-culture.png)

Given the core DevOps culture elements, there are many actions that organizations can take to develop and foster their internal DevOps culture:

* **Build mutual respect within and between its teams**: Teams should operate by using a code of ethics based on mutual respect and blameless culture. Teams should take collaborative ownership of any issues encountered during software delivery and identify improvement opportunities rather than looking for a culprit.

* **Clearly define roles and responsibilities of each individual team**: Team decision-making should be democratic, but structured to ensure that decisions are made efficiently. When there are differing opinions about a situation, someone must be responsible for making the final decision based on the evidence that's presented.

* **Facilitate continuous learning and improvement**: Organizations should establish architecture review boards and centers of excellence to develop and maintain their best practices in the areas of development, operations, and security. Team structure should ensure that everyone is a specialist in their function and a generalist in all other functions so that team members can support each other when needed.

* **Commit to optimization**: Business and customer-driven needs should be the primary factors that determine the overall DevOps strategy. The teams need to regularly review their standard operating procedures, apply creative thinking, and seek areas of improvement.

* **Embrace safe experimentation**: Organizations should develop means for testing and evaluating new functionality in isolation from the production environment and delivering innovative solutions in compliance with safe deployment practices.

Exemplifying these recommendations, Microsoft has a well-established live site culture that is based on the principles of DevOps. The company has a strong focus on customer satisfaction and operational excellence, and it has a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Key aspects of Microsoft's live site culture:

* Learn once and share.
