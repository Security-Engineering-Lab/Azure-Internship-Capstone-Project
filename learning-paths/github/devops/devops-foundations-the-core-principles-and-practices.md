DevOps is a concept that aims to address the challenges associated with traditional application lifecycle.

> "DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users." - Donovan Brown

Imagine that you work for a software development company in the retail industry. Your company is planning to migrate from an old app to a new app. However, the development team and the operations team have conflicting objectives. The development team wants to release new features quickly to attract more customers, while the operations team wants to ensure stability and reliability of the application. This conflict leads to delays in releasing new features and frequent downtime for the application. Your company realizes that it needs to adopt DevOps practices to overcome these challenges and deliver high-quality software efficiently and reliably.

# 1.2 What is DevOps?


https://youtu.be/kBV8gPVZNEE

DevOps is a commonly misunderstood and mischaracterized term. Before you explore more nuanced aspects of DevOps, it's essential that you understand its meaning and what DevOps isn't.

## What is DevOps (and what isn't)?

DevOps is a set of principles, practices, and values that are meant to enhance cross-team synergies, with the common goal of optimizing software delivery.

It's not a state that an organization can reach, but rather a continuous journey that requires an ongoing commitment and effort from all stakeholders.

It's also important to note that DevOps isn't tied to a specific technology or tools.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/discover-devops/media/2-devops-toolchain.png)

Now to explore DevOps in a contextual way, let's consider the traditional organization in the software development company example in which the development team and the operations team work in silos. Review challenges associated with this scenario and examine the meaning of DevOps in this context and how it can help.

## What challenges are associated with a traditional application lifecycle?

Traditional application lifecycle tends to separate developing software from the process of operationalizing it, which involves delivering it to its intended recipients and ensuring that it functions in the optimal manner. This siloed approach leads to many inefficiencies.

For one, developers and operational teams have commonly different objectives. The former focuses on innovation and continuous enhancements to their software. The primary objective of the latter is maintaining the stability and security of the environment they support.

The conflicting goals result in clashes, driving a wedge between different parts of the internal IT organization.

In addition, traditional operational practices are frequently based on an outdated, largely manual approach, which is inherently slow and vulnerable to human errors. This impedes the pace of innovation and increases the level of risk associated with deployment of new or updated versions of applications.

## How does DevOps help?

The purpose of DevOps is to address these inefficiencies. This is accomplished by uniting people, processes, and technologies. DevOps promotes coordination and collaboration between traditionally siloed roles, spanning such areas as development, operations, quality engineering, and security.


# 1.3 Explore DevOps culture

DevOps extends beyond technology, tools, and processes, forming an organizational culture. In the software-development company example, it becomes crucial to start by focusing on less tangible components of organizational life, such as team collaboration, shared responsibility, empowerment, continuous learning, and agile mindset. Here, use this context to examine DevOps culture and its key elements.

## What is DevOps culture?

DevOps culture encompasses the human and organizational factors that impact software development and delivery. As such, DevOps represents a culture that promotes collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility among all organizational stakeholders. The DevOps culture creates a collaborative, transparent, and continuously improving environment where teams work together to deliver high-quality software in an efficient and reliable manner. It involves a shift in mindset and behaviors, fostering a culture of trust, communication, and shared responsibility.

## What are the key elements of DevOps culture?

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/discover-devops/media/3-devops-culture.png)

The key elements of DevOps culture can be summarized as follows:

* **Collaboration:** DevOps encourages teamwork and open communication across teams, eliminating silos and improving efficiency.

* **Transparency:** Openness and visibility into development and operations processes enhance understanding and decision-making.

* **Shared responsibility:** DevOps emphasizes collective efforts and continuous improvements, replacing blame with collaboration.

* **Continuous learning:** The DevOps culture promotes regular process reviews, identifying areas for improvement and enhancing efficiency.

* **Measurable outcomes:** DevOps relies on the use of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to validate successful deliveries as well as to identify the need for innovations and enhancements. Measurable outcomes serve as an essential component of data-driven decision making and continuous learning.

* **Customer-centric focus:** DevOps values the customer's experience and emphasizes accelerated and reliable software delivery.

* **Agility:** DevOps organizations are adaptable and responsive to change, embracing an agile mindset.

* **Automation:** Automation increases efficiency, reduces errors, and accelerates development and deployment processes in DevOps.

* **Security Integration:** Security is an essential part of DevOps, permeating throughout each stage, which hints for the reason behind coining the term DevSecOps. DevSecOps is an extension of DevOps, with the focus on integrating security practices into the DevOps processes.



# 1.4 Explore DevOps goals and benefits

It should become fairly clear at this point that DevOps could bring significant value to practically any organization that relies on technology to deliver products and services to its customers. This certainly applies to the sample scenario we introduced in this module, where legacy operations negatively affected the pace of innovation and the risk associated with software deployment and maintenance. To appreciate the positive impact of DevOps, let's examine its benefits and goals in more detail.

## What are the primary goals and benefits of DevOps?

Embracing the DevOps culture can bring about a wide range of advantages for organizations, including:

* **Accelerating time to market**: Implementing DevOps practices facilitates the rapid release of software and its updates, reducing the time it takes to deliver them to their consumers. This acceleration enhances an organization's responsiveness to evolving customer needs and industry trends.

* **Adapting to market dynamics and competition**: DevOps fosters an agile and responsive development process, enabling organizations to quickly adapt to changes in the market and respond to competitive pressures. This adaptability ensures that businesses are able to adjust to evolving customer expectations.

* **Sustaining stability and reliability in operations**: DevOps principles emphasize collaboration between development and operations teams, leading to more stable and reliable operational environments. This collaboration helps identify and address issues early in the development cycle, minimizing disruptions and enhancing the overall stability of the operational environment.

* **Minimizing the mean time to recovery (MTTR)**: DevOps practices focus on automation, continuous monitoring, and rapid feedback loops, leading to quicker detection and resolution of issues. This, in turn, significantly improves the MTTR, ensuring that the impact of any disruption is minimized and that operations are quickly restored to their optimal state.

## Are DevOps benefits limited to traditional applications?

It's important to note that DevOps benefits extend beyond the lifecycle of traditional applications. Its scope includes, for example, such areas as machine learning (with operations applied to implementing machine learning models) and infrastructure (with Infrastructure as Code applied to deployment of underlying platform services).

*Machine Learning Operations*, often referred to as simply *MLOps*, focus on transitioning from the development of machine learning models to their provisioning in production environments. By following MLOps practices, organizations can ensure that their workloads are resilient and can be easily recreated. This includes monitoring, retraining, and redeploying models on an as-needed basis, and maintaining their stability following each deployment.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/discover-devops/media/4-machine-learning-operations.png)

*Infrastructure as Code*, commonly abbreviated as *IaC*, involves managing and provisioning compute, networking, and storage infrastructure via programming methods, rather than by relying on configuring physical hardware or using interactive administrative tools. IaC allows developers and operations teams to define and manage infrastructure elements such as servers, network devices, and databases using code. This code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable scripting language. The scripts are then executed to automate the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure, making it more efficient, consistent, and easily scalable.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/discover-devops/media/4-infrastructure-as-code.png)


# 1.5 Explore DevOps application lifecycle

While DevOps practices have a vast scope, their primary target is optimizing application lifecycle management. In the fictitious company example, migration from an existing app to a new app with updated features requires revisiting every phase of the application lifecycle. As such, learn how DevOps principles can significantly alter how each phase is implemented, from planning, through development and delivery, to operations. In this unit, step through a high-level overview of these implementations.

## Application Lifecycle phases

Application lifecycle phases include planning, development, delivery, and operations.

*Screenshot of the DevOps and Application Lifecycle.*

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/discover-devops/media/5-devops-lifecycle.png)

### Planning

The planning phase involves reviewing customer needs in order to outline and define features and capabilities of the software to be developed. Such software can range from individual microservices to portfolios consisting of multiple products. The outcome defines software requirements, scope, and milestones for the application's development and deployment. From the DevOps perspective, the primary considerations during this phase include agility, customer-centric focus, alignment, and visibility.

### Development

The development phase covers all aspects of developing application code. These aspects include programming, testing, and code reviews. To comply with DevOps practices, the code should reside in a source control system, which facilitates collaboration and supports versioning. A working version of the code is used to build artifacts suitable for subsequent delivery. Such artifacts can take the form of executable binaries, software libraries, container images, installer packages, configuration files, deployment scripts, or even documentation.

Changes at this phase should be applied in small increments through automated testing and build, referred to as continuous integration (CI), which accelerates the development process and enhances agility.

### Delivery

Delivery is the process of deploying the artifacts built during the development stage into production environments in a consistent and reliable manner. While the ultimate goal at this phase is full automation through continuous delivery (CD), some organizations, especially in early stages of their DevOps adoption, might choose to implement manual approvals or checks. As the confidence in DevOps practices grows, it's typically possible to fully automate these checks. For example, a successful, unattended verification of a deployment to a staging environment might serve as the basis for transitioning to the production environment. Automation helps make delivery processes scalable, repeatable, and, more resilient (by minimizing the possibility of human error). The key to a successful implementation of such an approach is following DevOps practices, including proper testing, the use of observable measurements, and continuous learning.

Delivery should also take into account provisioning and configuring the target environment's infrastructure through IaC. Treating infrastructure as code offers a range of benefits, including consistency, reproducibility, and agility.

### Operations

The operations phase involves maintaining, monitoring, and troubleshooting applications in production environments. From the DevOps perspective, the primary objectives at this stage are stability and reliability, rapid incident response, security and compliance, and customer satisfaction. To some extent, reaching these objectives is dependent on having properly implemented measurable outcomes. DevOps processes also rely on so called feedback loops that deliver data reflecting the current state of the deployed application such as performance metrics, responsiveness, and overall user experience, including improved or degraded functionality.

During this phase, it's important to ensure the maximum levels of collaboration between development, operations, and security teams. This phase also serves as the essential source of continuous learning.

## What's the final stage of the application lifecycle?

As the name indicates and the image at the beginning of this unit illustrates, the application lifecycle is, by design, a circular process. There's a deterministic beginning and end of an application lifespan determined by its inception and decommissioning events. However, following the initial deployment (or frequently, even earlier), feedback from users and monitoring data inform subsequent updates and the evolution of the application.

> **Note**
>
> Keep in mind that even though security was mentioned only a few times throughout this unit, according to DevSecOps principles, its role pervades throughout application lifecycle. Effectively, security-related considerations should be accounted for during each phase, starting at the very beginning of the initial planning.

# 2 Plan with DevOps

Plan your software development projects agilely using GitHub Projects boards. You'll facilitate collaboration, shared responsibility, continuous learning, and optimization through version control, continuous integration and continuous testing, and Infrastructure as Code.


# 2.1 Introduction

DevOps influences the entire application lifecycle starting with the planning phase.

Imagine that you work for a software development company in the retail industry. Your company is planning to migrate an online store from an old app to a new app to stay competitive in the market. The development and operations teams are working in silos, with little collaboration and communication, and lack of accountability, which has made planning your project more difficult. To address these issues, your organization decides to adopt a DevOps approach to build mutual respect among teams, set clearly defined roles and responsibilities, become agile, and implement practices that improve collaboration and communication.

In this module, learn how to foster a DevOps culture in an organization by promoting collaboration, transparency, shared responsibility, and continuous learning. You'll learn about the importance of an Agile approach to software development and project management as part of DevOps, the characteristics of different agile frameworks, fundamental DevOps practices such as version control, continuous integration, continuous testing, continuous delivery, continuous monitoring, continuous security, and Infrastructure as Code, and how GitHub Projects can facilitate the planning of your projects.

By the end of this module, you'll have a clear understanding of the principles, practices, and values of DevOps and how they can be applied to optimize application lifecycle management in every phase from planning to operations.


# 2.2 Foster DevOps culture


In order to fully realize DevOps benefits, organizations need to make a conscious effort of fostering the DevOps culture among their teams. This involves promoting collaboration, automation, and a mindset of continuous improvement, which ultimately will lead to faster, more reliable, and customer-centric software delivery. Such effort would be essential in our sample scenario, where the organization just started exploring the option to adopt DevOps practices. However, changing a corporate culture is a challenging undertaking. In this unit, you'll review a set of recommendations that should facilitate addressing this challenge.

## How should organizations foster DevOps culture?

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/plan-with-devops/media/2-foster-devops-culture.png)

Given the core DevOps culture elements, there are many actions that organizations can take to develop and foster their internal DevOps culture:

* **Build mutual respect within and between its teams**: Teams should operate by using a code of ethics based on mutual respect and blameless culture. Teams should take collaborative ownership of any issues encountered during software delivery and identify improvement opportunities rather than looking for a culprit.

* **Clearly define roles and responsibilities of each individual team**: Team decision-making should be democratic, but structured to ensure that decisions are made efficiently. When there are differing opinions about a situation, someone must be responsible for making the final decision based on the evidence that's presented.

* **Facilitate continuous learning and improvement**: Organizations should establish architecture review boards and centers of excellence to develop and maintain their best practices in the areas of development, operations, and security. Team structure should ensure that everyone is a specialist in their function and a generalist in all other functions so that team members can support each other when needed.

* **Commit to optimization**: Business and customer-driven needs should be the primary factors that determine the overall DevOps strategy. The teams need to regularly review their standard operating procedures, apply creative thinking, and seek areas of improvement.

* **Embrace safe experimentation**: Organizations should develop means for testing and evaluating new functionality in isolation from the production environment and delivering innovative solutions in compliance with safe deployment practices.

Exemplifying these recommendations, Microsoft has a well-established live site culture that is based on the principles of DevOps. The company has a strong focus on customer satisfaction and operational excellence, and it has a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Key aspects of Microsoft's live site culture:

* Learn once and share.
* Drive with data.
* Automate everything.
* Use telemetry to drive decisions.
* Embrace failure.
* Root cause is key.
* Lock down the environment.
* Monitor everything.
* Plan for scale.
* Live site first.
* Detect before customers.
* Configuration as code.


# 2.3 What is Agile?


We used the term agile in the previous module to describe one of the essential elements of DevOps culture, representing the ability to rapidly respond to customer feedback and needs. This term also appeared several times in the unit describing the correlation between DevOps and the application lifecycle. However, there's also another, more specific meaning of Agile (in the capitalized format), which describes an approach to software development and project management. Such an approach is commonly associated with DevOps practices. In our sample scenario, transitioning from the traditional Waterfall approach to Agile would help the organization realize a range of DevOps benefits. In this unit, explore the primary characteristics of Agile and examine its correlation with DevOps.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/plan-with-devops/media/3-agile-methods.png)


## Agile principles and values

Agile is an approach to software development that promotes team collaboration, continuous improvement, and automation, with the ultimate goal of faster, more reliable, and customer-centric software delivery. The term originated from the Agile Manifesto, created in 2001 by a group of software developers, providing a set of guiding principles for modern software development. The manifesto included four foundational statements that prioritized individuals and interactions, working solutions, and customer collaboration over rigid processes and tools. In particular, these statements assigned more value to:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

## Agile methods and practices

The Agile Manifesto and Agile principles provide a set of values and guidelines, but they're intentionally not prescriptive in terms of specific methods and practices. Instead, Agile is meant to be flexible and easily adaptable, allowing organizations and teams to choose a more detailed approach according to their preferences and needs.

These detailed, comprehensive approaches are commonly referred to as frameworks. Their purpose is to cover all phases of the DevOps lifecycle, including planning, development, delivery, and operations. Some of the more popular Agile frameworks include Scrum and Kanban.

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework used by teams to manage work and solve problems collaboratively in short (typically between one and four weeks long) iterations called sprints. To facilitate collaboration and progress, sprints are structured based on events, artifacts, and roles.

- **Events**, commonly referred to as ceremonies, include meetings taking place daily (Daily Scrum, typically limited to 15 minutes, also known as daily standup) and at the beginning and end of each sprint (Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective).
- **Artifacts** define a prioritized list of features, enhancements, and fixes to develop. Such artifacts might cover the span of a project or a sprint (Product Backlog or Sprint Backlog, respectively), or they might aid Daily Scrum meetings (task boards and sprint burndown charts). A task board provides a visual way to track the progress of each backlog item. It displays backlog items divided into the tasks required to complete it. Tasks are placed in separate columns (labeled To do, In progress, and Done) based on their status. The sprint burndown chart serves as a visual indicator of whether the team is on track to complete its assigned work by the end of the sprint. It consists of a graph that displays the daily total of remaining work, typically shown in hours.
- **Roles** include the product owner, Scrum master, and Scrum team, each with its clearly defined responsibilities. The product owner represents the project stakeholders and is responsible for defining, maintaining, and prioritizing the product backlog. The Scrum master oversees the Scrum process, looking for areas for improvements, resolving any blocking issues, and ensuring that the Scrum principles are followed. The Scrum team is responsible for building the product, with the ownership of its engineering and quality components.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/plan-with-devops/media/3-agile-scrum-lifecycle-diagram.png)


In the Sprint Planning event, the team chooses backlog items to work on during the upcoming sprint. The selection is made based on priority and an estimated amount of work required to complete an item. The metric called velocity is used to measure the amount of work a team can complete in a given sprint. Once the sprint execution starts, the team decides how to work on the Sprint Backlog items. During Sprint review, the team demonstrates their accomplishments to stakeholders. Sprint retrospective is part of continuous learning. It serves as the opportunity to review the most recently completed sprint, identify areas for improvement, and help determine the list of actions for the next sprint.

## What is Kanban?

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/plan-with-devops/media/3-what-is-kanban.png)

Kanban is the Japanese word for a signboard or billboard. In the context of Agile, the concept of Kanban has been conceived as a means for improving the efficiency of manufacturing processes, but, in recent years, it became prevalent in software development projects.

The key principle of this approach is visualization of project-related work in the form of Kanban boards. These can be physical boards or software applications that display cards arranged into columns representing the status of individual project items. Commonly used column names include To-do, Doing, and Done, although teams can customize them to accurately reflect all relevant stages in a project delivery workflow (such as development and testing). Visualizing work as cards in different states on a board simplifies the assessment of project status and identifying potential productivity issues.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/plan-with-devops/media/3-agile-kanban-board-sample.png)


These cards correspond to product backlog items in the Scrum framework. The cards can be customized to include references to other items in the product delivery process, such as tasks and test cases.

While the concept of a backlog is common in Kanban and Scrum, it's important to note that Kanban is more flexible and doesn't involve iterations. Work items can be added, reprioritized, or removed from the backlog based on the team's capacity and the changing needs of the project or service being managed with Kanban.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/plan-with-devops/media/3-kanban-pull-model.png)

In particular, Kanban promotes the use of a pull model, in which stakeholders add requests to the backlog list of tasks, items, or work that needs to be completed. The development team selects items from the backlog and adds them into the active work process depending on their priority and the team's resources availability. This minimizes the quality issues associated with the pull model, in which stakeholders arbitrarily assign work to development teams, frequently with unrealistic deadlines. In addition, to optimize productivity, Kanban supports imposing limits on the number of items that the development team is currently working on, referred to as work in progress or simply WIP.

Kanban framework also relies on lead time and cycle time metrics to measure effectiveness and throughput of its workflow. Lead time is the total time it takes for a work item to transition from its inception until its delivery to the customer. Cycle time represents the duration of the actual work on an item once it has been pulled into the active work state.

Another commonly used component of Kanban is a cumulative flow diagram (CFD). It's a chart that illustrates the number of items in each state over time, typically across several weeks. It resembles a stacked time series chart, with the horizontal axis representing the timeline and the vertical axis representing the cumulative number of work items. Each state is displayed as a differently colored area, facilitating identifying trends in backlog item processing. An increase in size of one or more colored areas typically indicates an issue in the workflow, such as a bottleneck or inefficiency.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/plan-with-devops/media/3-agile-kanban-cumulative-flow-diagram.png)

## What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban?

Both Scrum and Kanban are considered to be Agile frameworks with the common goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of software development. However, each of them offers a different approach to reaching this goal, including their respective principles and practices. In particular:

- **Work cadence**: Scrum uses fixed-length sprints, while Kanban operates based on a continuous flow model, with work being pulled by development teams according to the availability of their resources.
- **Roles and ceremonies**: Scrum has clearly defined roles and ceremonies, while Kanban doesn't prescribe any, instead allowing teams to adapt these according to their specific needs.
- **Work planning**: Scrum uses a prioritized backlog with work committed to during sprint planning. Kanban uses a dynamic backlog, with no commitments for a specific period. In addition, Kanban supports the concept of WIP limits.
- **Adaptability to change**: Scrum discourages changes to committed work during the sprint. Kanban facilitates adaptation to changes at any point.
- **Visualizations**: Scrum uses sprint boards and burndown charts. Kanban relies on Kanban boards.
- **Metrics**: Scrum uses sprint-related metrics such as velocity and burndown charts. Kanban emphasizes such metrics as lead time and cycle time.


# 2.4 Explore DevOps practices

Incorporating DevOps into the application lifecycle involves implementing a range of DevOps practices. The ability to maximize DevOps benefits is highly dependent on the extent to which this implementation is successful. In our sample scenario, the organization would need to introduce significant changes to its operating model, starting with promoting collaboration and communication between development and operations teams as well as investing in version control, automation, continuous integration, continuous testing, continuous delivery, and continuous monitoring. You'll explore these practices in this unit.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/plan-with-devops/media/4-devops-practices.png)

## Version control

Version control is the practice of managing updates to code by storing it in designated repositories, tracking its revisions, and maintaining change history. This facilitates code reviews and the ability to recover from programming errors. In addition, version control systems (VCS) such as Git allow for collaboration in code authoring among multiple developers through such features as repository cloning, pull requests, code change merges, conflict resolution, and support for rollbacks. The use of version control is a fundamental DevOps practice. Version control is also a prerequisite for such practices as continuous integration and infrastructure as code.

## Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Testing

One of the core practices of DevOps is automation. In this case, automation applies to the process of merging code changes, testing them, and building resulting artifacts, as early in the application lifecycle as possible. The intention is to detect any potential issues in the development phase, since this minimizes the effort and cost involved in fixing them. Automated tests validate that code changes haven't introduced errors or regression issues.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous delivery automates the process of deploying artifacts built as part of CI, making them available to their consumers. CD automates progression of these artifacts through different environments, such as testing, staging, and production. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) together form a unified, streamlined, end-to-end software development and delivery process.

## Continuous monitoring

Continuous monitoring provides automated real-time visibility into the health and performance of the entire application stack, including its underlying infrastructure. This is accomplished through the collection of telemetry, including logs and metrics, and customizable alerting that delivers notifications about anomalous behavior, facilitating prompt remediation actions.

## Continuous Security (DevSecOps)

Security is an essential part of every phase of the DevOps-based application lifecycle, which is the reason for coining the term DevSecOps. DevSecOps is an extension of DevOps, with the focus on integrating security practices into each stage—from planning, through coding, testing, and deployment, to operations.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code is an integral component of modern software development and operations practices. It involves the use of programming methods to provision and manage infrastructure services. IaC defines infrastructure components such as servers, network devices, and databases by using code. Such code typically resides in a VCS, which manages and tracks changes to infrastructure configurations. The use of code facilitates automated provisioning and configuration of infrastructure, enhancing efficiency, consistency, and scalability. In addition, IaC can be (and frequently is) integrated with CI/CD, yielding a comprehensive software delivery strategy by combining infrastructure provisioning, with application build, test, and deployment into one continuous, fully automated sequence.


# 2.5 Plan with GitHub

Both GitHub and Azure DevOps support a range of DevOps planning capabilities. Considering that the organization in the sample scenario plans to rely on GitHub for its DevOps transition, with focus on the former. In particular, explore GitHub Projects and Project Boards, available to all GitHub customers.

## What are GitHub Projects?

GitHub Projects is a feature hosted by the GitHub platform providing the ability to organize, track and manage work in a collaborative and visual manner. This feature is suitable for managing software development lifecycle, although it can be used in practically any scenario that involves project-related work. It closely integrates with other GitHub components such as repositories, issues, and pull requests. It provides a way to plan, track progress, and coordinate tasks within a repository and across repositories.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/plan-with-devops/media/5-github-projects.png)

Each project is automatically accessible in the table, board, and roadmap layout. You also have the option of creating views by filtering, grouping, and sorting components included in the project, generating configurable charts, and adding custom fields based on your individual preferences or needs.

GitHub Projects support milestones, which represent target dates of specific goals or deliverables. Milestones implement a timeline for the project and allow teams to track their progress.

Projects include built-in workflows that you can use to update the status of items based on predefined events, such as automatically setting the status of a newly created issue to Todo or automatically setting the status to Done when the issue is closed. By default, two workflows are enabled in a newly created project:

- When issues or pull requests in your project are closed, their status is set to Done
- When pull requests in your project are merged, their status is set to Done.

## What is a GitHub Projects board?

A GitHub Projects board offers a visual representation of the corresponding project. It's accessible via the board layout and supports a Kanban experience. It consists of columns and cards that allow you to organize and track issues and pull requests. Columns can be customized to represent different project stages. Cards represent work items, such as issues, draft issues, or pull requests. You can drag cards between columns to reflect their current status or stage of completion and the value of those items adjust to match the column you drag them to. Each card can contain many fields including labels, assignees, due dates, and descriptions. These fields allow you to specify additional information about the work being tracked.

By using the views functionality, you have the option to create multiple boards within a repository, each with its own, distinct set of columns. You can also set a limit for the number of cards in a particular column in a board layout to implement a WIP limit.

## How to start with GitHub Projects boards?

Before you start a new GitHub project, create a repository. A repository stores all of your project's files and provides a platform for managing your work and collaborating with others. To track project-related work items, use issues. Issues provide a convenient method for communicating and making decisions within a team, including discussions on application lifecycle details, such as bugs or performance reports, project planning, or brainstorming a new idea. To provide suggestions for improvements, use pull requests containing proposed changes.

In addition, consider using the default labels included in every repository or creating custom ones. Labels help with keeping track of project goals, designating bugs, differentiating between various types of work, and indicating the status of issues or pull requests. For example, you can locate all bugs in your project by filtering for issues with the corresponding label.

When creating a project, you can either start from scratch or use many project templates with predefined board structures targeting the most common use cases, including, for example, Team planning, Feature release, Kanban, Iterative development, or Bug tracker.

# 3 Develop with DevOps

Streamline updates to your software development projects by applying version control with Git and GitHub. Your software lifecycle improves through the implementation of continuous integration, shift-left testing, and shift-left security.


# 2.1 Introduction

Version control and source control are essential practices in DevOps, particularly in the development phase, enabling continuous integration and infrastructure as code.

Imagine that you work for a software development company in the retail industry that is planning to migrate an online store from an old app to a new app. The application is called eShopOnWeb with the necessary layered application architecture. However, the development team and the operations team have different processes for managing the development of the new app and this conflict leads to delays in releasing new features and increases the risk of errors in production. Your company decides to implement a DevOps approach, including the use of Git and GitHub, to facilitate software lifecycle management.

In this module, learn about the principles and benefits of version and source control, the differences between centralized and distributed version control systems, Git terminology and features for tracking changes, reviewing history, creating branches, merging branches, collaborating with multiple developers, and automating processes like continuous integration and deployment. Additionally, you'll also explore GitHub for hosting Git repositories and streamlining updates to project repositories, and the importance of integrating shift-left testing and shift-left security in the software lifecycle.

By the end of this module, you'll have a clear understanding of version control and source control principles, the usage of Git and GitHub for managing software development projects, the importance of continuous integration, and the shift-left approach for testing and security in DevOps.


# 2.2 Explore source control and version control

The use of source and version control is a fundamental DevOps practice. It's also a prerequisite for such practices as continuous integration and infrastructure as code, both of which are crucial to reaching the full DevOps potential. The organization in our sample scenario should review its current collaborative software development strategy and transition to a distributed version control model such as Git, especially considering its plans to use GitHub for its software lifecycle management. This, however, requires sound understanding of the version and source control principles and their benefits, which we'll cover here.

## Source control and version control

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/develop-with-devops/media/2-source-control.png)

The terms *source control* and *version control* are often used interchangeably, and in many contexts, they refer to the same concept. In general, both of them are associated with the practice of managing changes to code in a shared development environment. However, you might encounter more nuanced scenarios in which their meaning is slightly different. In these scenarios, *source control* designates a system that manages changes to source code files while *version control* includes change management of any file type for purposes that extend beyond source code alone. Going forward, for the sake of consistency, we'll be using the term *version control* to represent Git-based collaborative software repositories available in GitHub and Azure DevOps.

## What are the benefits of version control?

Version control keeps track of changes to files within its scope of management. This offers a wide range of benefits:

* **History and version tracking**: You have the ability to review history of changes to any file, including the ability to determine when each individual change took place and what was their scope. This also provides traceability, typically by associating each set of changes with a unique identifier.

* **Rollback and recovery**: If there's an error or an issue, you can easily revert changes to recover the known, working version of the affected file.

* **Branching and merging**: If you need to extend the functionality of the current code by adding another feature or fix a newly discovered bug, you can create a so-called branch, which allows you to work independently against the existing codebase. The new branch is initially identical to the *main* branch hosting the current code. Once you completed your changes, you merge the new branch with the main branch. While this might still lead to conflicts (if another developer decided to modify the same set of files in the meantime via another branch), their scope is limited and they can typically be easily identified and resolved.

![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/develop-with-devops/media/2-branch-strategy.png)

* **Collaboration and parallel development**: Conflict resolution provisions supplemented by branching and merging facilitate having multiple developers working on the same codebase, which increases efficiency. With distributed control systems, such as Git, it's even possible to author code in a disconnected mode. Collaboration also involves mutual peer reviews of pull requests, promoting knowledge sharing and transparency.

* **Automation**: Version control is an essential part of continuous integration and automated deployments. Automated build and testing can be triggered automatically whenever a new version of the code is pushed to the version control repository or merged with the main branch. Different versions of the code can be deployed into different environments.
