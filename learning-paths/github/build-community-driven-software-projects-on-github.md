# 1) Introduction to GitHub
# 2) Manage an InnerSource program by using GitHub
# 3) Create an open-source program by using GitHub best practices
Learn to create a successful open-source program by establishing contributor guidance, following proven processes, and by using community standards.

# 3.1 Introduction

Open-source software programs have enjoyed major success for decades. Although there are different flavors of open-source licenses, they all share similar principles of transparency and inclusiveness that have produced some of the most powerful projects ever.

Suppose you're a leader at a company that has developed some substantial software projects. These projects have been proprietary since inception, but now you're investigating the possibility of open-sourcing one or more of them. You then try to determine which candidates would be best to publish. Now, you begin to realize that running a successful program is more than just uploading source code to a public repository. It requires careful collaboration with stakeholders from across the company. It also introduces a new mindset for exposing intellectual property in a way that might be entirely new for the company. Lastly, it involves lots of work to set up and maintain; but for some projects, you know it's worth it.

In this module, you'll learn how to create a successful open-source program by establishing contributor guidance, following proven processes, and by using community standards.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:
- Assess your organization's existing open-source efforts
