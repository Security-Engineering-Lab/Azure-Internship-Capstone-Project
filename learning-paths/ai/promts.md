#### Cultural Movement Curriculum Design

Hi Claude! Could you create a curriculum inspired by my favorite cultural movement? If you need more information from me, ask me 1-2 key questions right away. If you think I should upload any documents that would help you do a better job, let me know. You can use the tools you have access to — like Google Drive, web search, etc. — if they’ll help you better accomplish this task. Do not use analysis tool. Please keep your responses friendly, brief and conversational. 

Please execute the task as soon as you can - an artifact would be great if it makes sense. If using an artifact, consider what kind of artifact (interactive, visual, checklist, etc.) might be most helpful for this specific task. Thanks for your help!

I'd love to help you create a curriculum inspired by your favorite cultural movement! To get started, I need to know:

1. **Which cultural movement** is your favorite? (e.g., Harlem Renaissance, Bauhaus, Beat Generation, etc.)

2. **What's the intended audience** for this curriculum? (e.g., high school students, college level, general adult learners, etc.)

Once I know these details, I can create a comprehensive curriculum as an interactive artifact that you can reference and modify. No need to upload documents right now - I can research the movement and create something tailored to your needs!

I'd love to help you develop teaching strategies! To create the most useful resource for you, I need to understand your specific context:

1. **What subject and grade level** are you teaching (or planning to teach)?
2. **What's your main challenge** - are you looking for general teaching strategies, ways to engage students, classroom management techniques, or something else specific?

Once I know these details, I can create a comprehensive teaching strategies guide tailored to your needs. If you have any existing lesson plans, curriculum documents, or student assessment data, those could be helpful to upload, but I can also work without them based on your answers to the questions above.

What's your teaching situation?

I'd be happy to help summarize your academic papers! To do the best job, I need to know:

1. **Where are your papers located?** Are they in your Google Drive, or would you prefer to upload them directly to our chat?

2. **What type of summary are you looking for?** A brief overview of each paper, key findings across all papers, or something more specific like research themes/methodologies?

I don't currently have access to Google Drive or other internal tools in this conversation, so uploading the papers directly would be the most reliable approach. Once I can access your papers, I'll create a well-organized summary artifact that you can easily reference and share!

#### Research Question Design Strategy

Hi Claude! Could you design research questions? If you need more information from me, ask me 1-2 key questions right away. If you think I should upload any documents that would help you do a better job, let me know. You can use the tools you have access to — like Google Drive, web search, etc. — if they’ll help you better accomplish this task. Do not use analysis tool.

I'd love to help you design research questions! To create the most useful questions for your specific needs, I need to understand:

1. **What's your research topic or field?** (e.g., psychology, marketing, education, etc.)
2. **What type of research are you planning?** (e.g., academic study, market research, user experience research, etc.)

Once I know these basics, I can create a comprehensive set of research questions tailored to your project. An interactive artifact would work well here - I could create a structured guide that walks you through different types of research questions with examples you can customize.

Any specific documents about your research area or project goals that you could share would definitely help me make this more targeted!

### Response:

Hi! I'd love to help you find credible sources for your research. To get you the most relevant and useful sources, I need to know:

1. **What's your research topic or question?** (e.g., climate change impacts, historical event, scientific concept, etc.)

2. **What type of sources do you need?** (academic journals, government reports, news articles, books, or a mix?)

Once I know these details, I can search for high-quality, credible sources and create a helpful resource list for you!
